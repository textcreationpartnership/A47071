            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Containing a Scriptural Deſcription of Magiſtracy; alſo ſhewing that it is an Ordinance of God, what kind of Ordinance, and in what reſpect it is an Ordinance of Man.</head>
               <p>IT being the uſual method of Architects when they undertake a piece of building, in the firſt place to draw in a narrow compaſs a Platform of the ſame, according to which they afterwards raiſe the Structure: I think it not unprofitable for me to imitate them; I ſhall therefore preſent you with a Platform of the following work, I mean a Deſcription of Magiſtracy, which comprehends in a few words thoſe ſeveral Particulars which are the ſubject of this Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>Magiſtracy is an Ordinance of God, for the right ordering of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths; whereby ſuch as are meet for Government, are lawfully called to ſerve God and the People therein, for his Glory and their Good, in the execution of Judgement, and protection of thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their charge, and receive due Power, Honour, Tribute, and Obedience therefore. This Deſcription takes in eſpecially theſe ſeven Particulars; 1. The Nature of Magiſtracy. 2. The End of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy. 3. The Call of Magiſtrates. 4. The Qualifications. 5. The Relation of Magiſtrates. 6. The Duty. 7. The Due of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, or what is due to them from the People; which is as much as I judge neceſſary at this preſent ſeaſon for the handling of this point.</p>
               <p>I ſhall endeavour in the ſtrength of God to treat of them all diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from Scripture and right Reaſon, with what brevity and perſpicuity this weighty and knotty Subject, and the capacity of common Readers will allow.</p>
               <p>The Lord open my underſtanding, that I may underſtand the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which relate to this Subject, and ſo guide me by his Spirit, that knowing I may make known his mind concerning this great Ordinance of his, which hath ſo long been abuſed; and thereby inſtruct the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and convince the Gainſayers of thoſe Truths, which the Scriptures deliver concerning the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Then to begin with the Nature of Magiſtracy.</p>
               <p>It is an Ordinance of God for the right ordering of Commonwealths. That Magiſtracy is an Ordinance of God, is ſo clear from the abundant
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95245:3"/>
Teſtimony which the Scriptures give thereunto, both in the old and new Teſtament, and ſo Univerſally acknowledged by all ſober and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional perſons, that I ſhall only mention a few Scriptures for proof of it, and ſo proceed. <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.18.— <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. to 4.—<hi>Titus</hi> 3.1.— 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13, and 14.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>But the Queſtion will be, what kind of Ordinance this is? for we read of ſeveral ſorts of God's Ordinances; Ordinances of the Paſſeover,</hi> Numb. 9.12. <hi>Ordinances of the Houſe of God,</hi> Ezek. 44.5. <hi>Ordinances of Divine Service,</hi> Heb. 9.1. <hi>Ordinances of Juſtice,</hi> Iſa. 58.2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is an Ordinance of Juſtice or Righteouſneſs inſtituted by God, for the execution thereof, that Commonwealths may be ordered in a juſt and righteous manner.</p>
               <p>God is the God of Order, and as he delights therein, ſo hath he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Order for all his Creatures, but eſpecially for Man; Order for every one as conſidered apart; order for Societies of men, and thoſe of ſeveral ſorts, which I ſhall not here enumerate. There are politick or civil Societies, and in theſe men, as men, joyn together to live by Rules of common Right, for civil Comfort and Security. There are Societies Eccleſiaſtical; in theſe men, as Saints, joyn together to live by Rules of Goſpel-Order, for the Glory of God, and mutual edification in Faith, and Holineſs. The former are uſually termed Commonwealths, the latter Churches; which as they differ in name, ſo alſo in nature, as is hinted above, having different Subjects, Laws, Governours, Duties and Ends.</p>
               <p>The latter ſort of Societies fall not under preſent conſideration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Magiſtracy is an Ordinance inſtituted for all mankind; and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates have the care of men, as men, committed to their charge, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.3. as is alſo clear by this, that Heathen Magiſtrates, if righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, are true Magiſtrates; although I deny not, but Saints, as men, are bound to ſubmit to this great Ordinance as well as others; and as they are members of civil Communities, are obliged by thoſe Rules of common right which other members are.</p>
               <p>Politick or civil Societies, uſually termed Commonwealths, are the proper Objects of this Ordinance; which, as they cannot ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Order and Government, ſo according to their various inclinations and occaſions, conſtitute Governours over them, according to thoſe ſeveral forms and manners of Government which ſeveral Nations de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in: And thus the very ſavage <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Americans</hi> themſelves, live in ſome meaſure of obedience unto this great Ordinance of God; the Light of Nature convincing them, that Government is neceſſary to their well-being; ſhewing hereby the work of the Law written in their
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95245:3"/>
hearts; as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. for this Ordinance of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, is a branch of that Law, as you may ſee, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.18. and many other places. But although Magiſtracy, in the general, be an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God, yet as to the ſeveral kinds and manners of it, is an Ordinance or Conſtitution of man, God having left men to their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to make choice of this or that manner of Government, which in the beſt of their underſtanding, ſeems moſt conducible to his Glory, and their own ſecurity; for God hath not left men to an abſolute liberty, to chuſe what Government they pleaſe, without reſpect to the ends of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; but all Nations and People are obliged by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſeriouſly to conſult and wiſely to conſider, what form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is moſt expedient for them, and beſt correſponding with the Ends of Government, and to chuſe that.</p>
               <p>Now, what-ever righteous form of Government a Nation chuſes, may in that ſenſe be called their Ordinance or Conſtitution; and yet as it is grounded upon the Law of God, it is God's Ordinance alſo, and obligeth all that live under it to ſubjection.</p>
               <p>And this is the true meaning of that place, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13, to 16. <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your ſelves to every Ordinance of man for the Lord's ſake:</hi> it is not meant (as the wicked Antichriſtian-Prelates would perſwade the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to believe) every Law of man, good or bad, righteous or unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; for we know that neither Chriſt, the Prophets, or Apoſtles, would ſubmit to wicked ſtatutes or ordinances of their Governours; but every righteous Conſtitution or kind of Government, called the Ordinance of man, becauſe God hath left men to their liberty, to chuſe what <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Government may be moſt conducible to their own good.</p>
               <p>Having given you a deſcription of Magiſtracy, and ſhewn you that it is an Ordinance of God, what kind of Ordinance, what is the proper Object of it, and in what ſence it is an Ordinance of man, I ſhall cloſe this firſt Chapter, and in the next treat of the ſecond particular, the End of Magiſtracy.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Treating of the Ends for which this great Ordinance was inſtituted by God; that is, for his own Glory, and the Peoples good. Alſo ſhewing that theſe ſhould be the Peoples ends in electing Governours, and Governours ends in accepting and executing their Office.</head>
               <p>THe ſecond Particular which falls under conſideration, is the End or Ends of this great Ordinance, <hi>The Glory of God, and good of the People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The Honour and Glory of God. Magiſtrates are called God's Miniſters, or Servants, as the Word ſignifies, and is frequently render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in other places; <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. <hi>He is the Servant of God. Now a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant honoureth his Maſter, Mal.</hi> 1.6. they being by their Office Servants of God, are bound in their ſeveral places to ſeek how they may honour and glorifie Him. Therefore <hi>David</hi> exhorteth the Mighty (or Princes of the Earth, as the Word often ſignifies, and the Contents of your Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles have it) to <hi>give Glory to God,</hi> Pſal. 29.1. yea, repeats the Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thrice together, to let us underſtand, that they in an eſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner are obliged to promote and advance the glory of God. Therefore that good King <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> in that pious charge which he gives to the Judges, to judge faithfully, couragiouſly, impartially, and in the fear of God, uſes this as his argument to enforce the Exhortation; <hi>For ye judge not for man, but for God,</hi> 2 Chron. 19.6. your work is not to pleaſe men, but to honour and glorifie God, for whom ye judge: And becauſe <hi>Eli</hi> had not ſo careful a reſpect to this end, but honoured his Sons before God, ſuffering them to make their own ends of God's Ordinance, the Lord rejected him and his poſterity; depriving them not only of the Office of Cheif-Prieſt, but Chief-Magiſtrate alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eli</hi> was the chief Magiſtrate, and had judged the Land 40 years, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.18. and the Lord had promiſed that his Houſe ſhould walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Him for ever; but the meaning was upon condition, that he and his poſterity honoured God in their places; but when he neglected to honour God, the Lord refuſed to honour him or his poſterity, with that Office, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30. and denounces one of the moſt dreadful tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Judgments againſt him and his poſterity that the Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Good of the People. Therefore the Apoſtle treating of Magiſtracy in its Inſtitution, as the Ordinance of God, and of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates acting in conformity thereto, drawes a ſtrong argument for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95245:4"/>
to them from the end of Magiſtracy; <hi>For</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>he is the Servant of God to thee for good,</hi> Rom. 13.4. as if he ſhould have ſaid, I have indeed exhorted you to be ſubject to Magiſtracy as it is an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, and ſhewn you the danger of reſiſting that Ordinance, or thoſe that act conformably thereunto; but do not miſtake me, as if I had no other argument to urge for your ſubjection, than God's Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, that it is his Ordinance, and therefore you muſt be ſubject; I tell you one end for which God inſtituted this Ordinance, was <hi>your Good;</hi> he hath not only conſulted his own Glory in this Ordinance, but your benefit and advantage.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee how the Lord draws us with the cords of a man, and bands of love, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.4. as well in this as other Ordinances of his; he deals with man as a rational creature, and propoſes arguments ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his nature, and conducing to his advantage, thereby to allure him to ſubjection to his moſt righteous will; and what a tender regard the Lord had, as well to the good of mankind, as the glory of his own name, in the Inſtitution of this Ordinance.</p>
               <p>And if theſe be Gods Ends in this Ordinance, ſurely they ſhould be the Peoples alſo: if theſe be the ends of Gods Inſtitution of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, they ſhould be the Peoples in Election of them. I ſhall ſhew you hereafter, that by the Law of God and Nature, the People have an undoubted right to make their Governours; but you muſt not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand an abſolute or arbitrary power to chuſe what Government or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours the Devil and their own luſts ſhall excite them to, but ſuch a form of Government and ſuch Governours, as may anſwer the end of God's Ordinance, his Glory, and their own Good.</p>
               <p>How careful alſo ſhould Magiſtrates be to anſwer the end for which they were ordained by God; theſe ought to be, yea, are the great ends of every true Magiſtrate, to honour God, and ſerve his Generation: He that ſeeks his own advantage by the Government, neglecting the ends above mentioned, doth not deſerve the Name of a Magiſtrate, and is indeed a real Tyrant, uſurping thoſe Titles which are due to a true and righteous Magiſtrate.</p>

God himſelf by his own Voice, appointed <hi>Joſhua</hi> to his Office: This Call is eaſily known by ſome ſigns or tokens, whereby the Lord makes known his mind to the People; as <hi>Moſes,</hi> to ſatisfie the people that he was called of God, gave them ſigns by God's appointment, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.1, to 9. So <hi>Joſhua</hi> had ſome of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s honour put upon him, that all the Congregation of Iſrael might be obedient unto him, <hi>Numb.</hi> 27.20. that is, as I conceive, an extrrordinary portion of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Spirit, was given to him to qualifie him for that great Truſt which he was to undertake, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.17. to 26. We read the Lord took of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that was upon <hi>Moſes,</hi> and gave it to the Seventy which were to aſſiſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95245:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
him in the Government: No doubt the ſame, but in a greater meaſure, was beſtowed upon <hi>Joſhua,</hi> as one who was not only to aſſiſt, but ſucceed <hi>Moſes</hi> in the place of chief Magiſtrate, that the people (ſeeing the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his Spirit) might be content to hearken to him; which is evident by <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.9. <hi>Joſhua, the ſon of Nun, was fall of the Spirit of Wiſdom, for Moſes had laid his hands on him, and the Children of Iſrael hearkened unto him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Call very near to this, though not in the ſtrickeſt ſence, <hi>Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate,</hi> was that of <hi>Gideon, Judg.</hi> 6.14. who was called by an <hi>Angel</hi> ſent from Heaven; and perhaps many other of the Judges were called in the ſame manner: but whoever hath this Call, hath ſomething or other, either in the manner of his Call, or in the excellency of his Spirit, or both, which is ſufficient to convince the People, that he is one appointed by God to be their Governour, and that it is their duty to hearken to, and obey him; as the People did <hi>Joſhua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a <hi>mediate</hi> Call, when God calls a man to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by and with the conſent and concurrence of the people: And thus the Kings of Iſrael were called, by the conſent of the people, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted them; and it was the Peoples right by the Law of God to ſet the King over them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.14, 15. 'twas the Peoples act that conſtituted the King.</p>
               <p>Therefore we read all the People went to <hi>Gilgal</hi> to make <hi>Saul</hi> King, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.15. The people made <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.4. and afterwards all the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> came to <hi>Hebron</hi> to make him King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.38. <hi>Solomom</hi> was made King by all the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.20. All the People came to <hi>Shechem</hi> to make <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam</hi> King, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 10.1. and when he refuſed to eaſe them of their burdens and oppreſſions, rejected him, and made <hi>Jeroboam</hi> King, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.20. All the people of <hi>Judah</hi> took <hi>Uzziah,</hi> and made him King, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.1. The people of the Land made <hi>Joſiah</hi> King, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.25. The people of the Land took <hi>Jehoahaz</hi> and made him King, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.1. The people made <hi>Abimeleck</hi> King, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.6. By all which it plainly appears, that the right of making Kings was in the People.</p>
               <p>The ſame we find concerning all other Magiſtrates and Officers, that the people were to make them by the Law of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Judges and Officers ſhalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which the Lord thy God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth thee throughout thy Tribes, and they ſhall judge the people with juſt judgement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed it is a piece of greateſt folly and imprudence for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to part with their right of making Magiſtrates, either Supream or Subordinate: to commit the making of Judges and other Officers to the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95245:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
King, is by interpretation a neglect of our own duty which the Law of God requires, an undervaluing of our birth-right, and a reſignation of our Laws, Lives, Liberties, and Eſtates, to his will: which King <hi>James</hi> knew well enough to be an eminent expedient of King-craft, when he uſed to ſay, <hi>Let me make what Judges and Biſhops I will, and I will have nothing to be Law or Goſpel but what I pleaſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No wonder that the people of this Nation are ſo grievouſly oppreſſed by <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Lawyers,</hi> that the Law is ſo wreſted, Juſtice perverted, and Violence committed, when they neglect their duty of making <hi>Judges, Sheriffs, Juſtices</hi> of the <hi>Peace,</hi> and other Officers, and commit it to the <hi>King;</hi> who will be ſure to chuſe ſuch as ſhall advance his Prerogative, and debaſe the Peoples Liberty as much as lies in them, and dare do no other for fear of his diſpleaſure; how eaſie a thing is it to take away any mans Life, Liberty, or Eſtate, which the King hath a deſire to take away, and that under a pretence of Law, when the <hi>Judge, Sheriff, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices,</hi> and <hi>Jury,</hi> are all his Creatures and Vaſſals; and the <hi>Judge</hi> muſt ſay that is Law which the <hi>King</hi> would have <hi>ſo,</hi> or elſe be turned out of his place, which uſually he hath bought at the price of ſome Thouſands of pounds.</p>
               <p>The Sheriff muſt pick a Jury that he knowes before-hand will give what verdict the Judge bids them, or elſe be judged an <hi>enemy</hi> to the King: And the Juſtices upon the Bench, dare as well go upon hot coals, as oppoſe the Kings <hi>Pleaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And never will it be otherwiſe, unleſs the people grow ſo wiſe, as to challenge their right by the Law of God, to make Judges and Officers themſelves, who may execute juſt Judgement.</p>
               <p>If a People will be ſo baſe, as like <hi>Eſau,</hi> to contemn their birth-right, and neglect their duty, &amp; cowardly or careleſly to reſign their Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges into the hands of a <hi>King;</hi> 'tis no wonder if they ſmart for it, as <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> at this day; if the people were ſo wiſe as to make Judges &amp; all other Officers themſelves, according to the Law of God, they could not be ſo abuſed as they are.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But doth not the Law ſay, that the people were to make him King whom the Lord ſhould chuſe?</hi> Deut. 17.15. <hi>It ſhould ſeem by this, that the people have not liberty to make ſuch as they pleaſe, but are to accept of ſuch as God hath appointed for the Government.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This argued that God did intend often, out of his eſpecial favour to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to make the choice himſelf of the perſon that ſhould reign over them; but this did not at all infringe the peoples rights or liberties; for the Lord to ſhew how tender he was of the peoples liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, at the ſame time when he choſe for them, appointed them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95245:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
him. God choſe him, but they made him King. I ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but if God be pleaſed at any time in an extraordinary manner to chooſe a Governour for us, and ſend a Prophet to make known his mind to us, as he did <hi>Samuel</hi> to appoint <hi>Saul,</hi> and after him <hi>David; Ahijah</hi> to appoint <hi>Jeroboam; Eliſha</hi> to appoint <hi>Jehu,</hi> it is our duty to make him King: But God doth not do ſo with other Nations as he did with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> He hath not ſent any Prophet to tell us whom he appoints, but hath left all Nations to their undubitable birth-right, to conſtitute ſuch Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours over them, as in the beſt of their underſtanding are rightly qualified for it.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But doth not Conqueſt or Hereditary Succeſſion manifeſt the will of God to us, and oblige us to conſtitute a perſon, now that extraordinary way of revealing the mind of God by Prophets ceaſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> As for Conqueſt, the pretence of a right to the Government over others from it, is ſo groſly irrational and injurious to mankind, that it ſcarcely deſerves an Anſwer; a Title not allowed by the tamer ſort of bruit beaſts, a title fit to be owned among none but beaſts of prey. For what is Conqueſt (ſimply conſidered) but Violence? and the continuation thereof but a continued Oppreſſion?</p>
               <p>I know the Advocates of Tyranny, urge that of <hi>Nebuchadezzar's</hi> Title to govern <hi>Judah</hi> and all the Nations round about by Conqueſt; and of the Lords Peoples right to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the neighbour Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by the ſame, but it is a groſſe miſtake. For the right <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> had to the Land of <hi>Judah,</hi> was not by Conqueſt, but Donation from God, and the Lord ſent the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to tell the People of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> and all the Nations round about, That he had given all thoſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and his Sons for the ſpace of ſeventy years, and threatens to puniſh that Nation that would not ſerve him, with the Sword, Famine and Peſtilence, <hi>Jer.</hi> 27.1, to 9. So likewiſe, 'twas the Lord's Donation that gave <hi>Iſrael</hi> a Title to thoſe Nations, and we know well, <hi>That the Earth is the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof, and he may give it to whom he pleaſeth.</hi> If any one can prove infallibly, that God hath made him a grant of the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> to him and his Heirs for ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years or more, I think it our duty to acquieſce in the ſoveraign will and good pleaſure of God, and not to oppoſe it; but if this cannot be proved, it is in vain to plead Conqueſt. Force and Right are as oppoſite to one another as Light and Darkneſs. A Pirate that hath conquered a Ship may plead as much right to govern it as a Conqueror to govern a Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>And as for Succeſſion by Birth, though it be an Argument of a paler Complexion than Conqueſt, (which is a Title died in Blood) yet
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95245:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hath it as little ſtrength as the other. My meaning is, that Royal Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeniture alone, without the Peoples Conſent, is no rightful Title to the Government. Or, that the eldeſt Son or Heir of a King, lawfully begotten (to ſay nothing of Baſtards) hath no right to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Birth, unleſs the People conſent to Chooſe him thereunto.</p>
               <p>Which I prove thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is directly contrary to the Law of Nature in many reſpects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It makes the whole inferiour to a part, yea to one member, which is moſt abſurd, for if a man may Govern over a Common-wealth without their conſent, then are they inferiour to him; the Will of one man muſt be preferred above the Will of the whole, perhaps many millions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This pretence of a right to the Government by Birth, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſheth Nature it ſelf, offers violence to her. For, whereas ſhe juſtly claims a power conſtitutive of Magiſtrates, and hath derived it to the People as her Truſtees, this Argument would deprive both them and her thereof.</p>
               <p>That Nature hath committed the conſtitution of Governours to the People, is clear, becauſe ſhe hath not determined the Heirs of Kings any more than others; yea Nature is often more liberal in beſtowing her Magiſtratical endowments on many thouſands (ſometimes on the greateſt number of men) than on the Royal Progeny, as they are called; and gives more Wiſdom, Courage, Kindneſs, Temperance, Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Juſtice to common People than to the Eldeſt Son of a King.</p>
               <p>How many thouſands in a Nation might be found whoſe natural tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament is more enclinable to Virtue then we often ſee a Kings to be. Now all wiſe men know 'tis Virtue that enobles the Spirit, and makes it capable of higheſt undertakings.</p>
               <p>How often may we ſee Kings fierce in their Countenance, cruel in their Natures, implacable, ungrateful, effeminate, falſe, luxurious, and univerſally vitious, and theſe things even radicated in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions, when there are many thouſand perſons, of a common, yet more truly noble extract? amiable in their Countenance, affable in their Carriage, faithful in their Promiſe, temperate in their Manners, and generally enclined to Virtue. Now ſurely if Nature hath deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any one to Superiority, it is the moſt virtuous. Therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, <hi>That Nature is no Friend to this Hereditary Title.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is juſt matter of laughter and diſdain, to read thoſe ignorant and impudent pretences which ſome men make to the Government from
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95245:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Nature, when the ſtreets abound daily with multitudes that by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Law have a better Title to it than themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This pretence formalizeth all the Commonwealth Vaſſals. It pronounceth the People home-born Slaves. Which, what ingenuous ſpirit can bear? For, if all the People muſt, againſt their Wills, be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to one man, and honour, maintain and obey him, what more perfect character of Vaſſalage than this? Thoſe wretches that knowingly plead for this Title, deſerve to be ſtigmatized in the foreheads as common enemies to mankind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Nay, this pretence of a right to the Government by Birth, without the conſent of the People, diveſts the People of all Power of Self-preſervation; for the Office of the Magiſtrate (as I ſhall ſhew more hereafter) is to protect and defend the People, and the common ſecurity of the People lyes in having good Governours: Now if the Eldeſt Son of a King be a perſon vitiouſly enclined, one given to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, revenge, luxury, intemperance, avarice, falſity, or the like Vices, and yet the People bound to accept of him for their Governour becauſe of his Birth, they muſt be bound to renounce their own ſafety, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace deſtruction; which the Law of Nature forbids, and common Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will abhor.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee how this pretended Birth-right to the Government doth violate the Law of Nature, and tend to cheat the People of their real Birth-rights, Liberty and Security. Let us enquire a little into Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and we ſhall find that it is as contrary to Scripture as Nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Scripture gives not the leaſt countenance unto this pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Title of Birth-right to the Government; and no wonder, for it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was the intent of God, to repeal the Law of Nature by Scripture, but to explain and confirm the ſame. But that I may argue diſtinctly, conſider theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Law of God concerning the making of a King, hath not a word of this: The Law doth not enjoyn the People to make the Eldeſt Son of a King Governour in his Fathers ſtead, or ſpeaks of an Hereditary Title to the Crown, but plainly intimates the contrary, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.15, to the end. For firſt, the Law requires qualifications in him that the People were to ſet over them; He muſt be one thus and thus qualified, which I ſhall open more fully in the next Chapter. Now if the King muſt be one ſo and ſo qualified, it plainly intimates, that there was no ſuch Title to the Government as Birth-right. For, if the Eldeſt Son of a King were not ſo qualified, the People could not ſet him over them, without diſobeying the Law of God.</p>
               <p>Again, The Law layes conditions of Government upon the King,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95245:8"/>
upon the obſervation whereof, He and his Children are to prolong their dayes in the Kingdom. He muſt not multiply Horſes to himſelf, nor Wives, nor greatly multiply Silver and Gold. He muſt read in the Law of God all the dayes of his life, that he may learn to fear God and keep all his Statutes; and he muſt not lift up his heart above his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, nor turn aſide from Gods Commandement to the right hand or the left; and if he and his children did thus, they were to continue in the Kingdom. But now ſuppoſe a King and his Children will multiply Horſes, Silver and Gold to themſelves, and lay unreaſonable Taxes on the People to maintain their pride and luxury, live in the preſumptuous violation of the Law of God, and lift up their hearts above their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, lord and domineer over them, and break all the conditions of Government; Were the People bound to accept of the Eldeſt Son of the King to ſucceed his Father in the Throne? No ſuch thing. They break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Conditions of Government forfeit their Right, and the People might lawfully ſet another over them, as they did when <hi>Rehoboam</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly rejected the Law of God, and would not eaſe them of their Burdens, 1 <hi>Kings,</hi> 12.16. chooſing <hi>Jeroboam</hi> in his ſtead.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſpecial grant that God made of the Kingdom to <hi>David,</hi> and his Seed, doth not in the leaſt favour this Hereditary Title. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Promiſe was not that the Kingdom ſhould deſcend to his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, in an Hereditary manner, that the Eldeſt Son ſhould ſucceed the Father in the Throne; if any of <hi>Davids</hi> Sons were made King by the People, it was as much as God had promiſed <hi>David,</hi> or the People were bound to. For neither did the Law of God, nor the grant made to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> oblige the People to the Eldeſt Son; and therefore we read that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſucceeded <hi>David</hi> in the Throne, a younger Brother to <hi>Adonijah,</hi> but a wiſer man, and no queſtion upon that account preferred before him, and promoted to the Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Deed of Gift made to <hi>David</hi> and his Seed, was not abſolute but conditional; upon condition that they kept the Law of God and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted his judgements, they were to continue in the Throne, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 6.12. — 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.25.— 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2.3, 4. But when <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> and <hi>Rehoboam</hi> his Son had violated the Conditions of Government, the People caſt off <hi>Rehoboams</hi> yoke from their ſhoulders; and good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for they were bound to him and his Seed only upon condition they obſerved the Law of God; and therefore by his rebellion againſt God, and reſolution to tyrannize over them, they had a juſt diſcharge from ſubjection to him and his Heirs. And a Nation can oblige themſelves
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95245:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to any man and his poſterity, no otherwiſe than conditionally, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they obſerve the Law of God and execute his Judgments: for to make an abſolute Engagement to a Prince, to receive his eldeſt Son, and accordingly his Poſterity for their Governours, what kind of perſons ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may prove, were contrary to the Law of Nature, a giving away their own and poſterities Birthrights, and to the Law of God, which requires qualifications in Governours, which will be more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleared in the next Chapter.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But we reade that</hi> Jehoſhaphat <hi>when he died gave the Kindom to</hi> Jehoram, <hi>becauſe he was the firſt-born,</hi> 2 Chron. 21.3. <hi>and the People made</hi> Ahaziah <hi>the youngeſt ſon of</hi> Jehoram <hi>King in his fathers ſtead, for the Band of men had ſlain all the eldeſt,</hi> 2 Chron. 22.1. <hi>Doth not this prove that the firſt-born, or eldeſt ſon of a King hath a right to the Crown after his fathers deceaſe?</hi>

For whereas it is ſaid <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> gave him the Kingdom, that implies that it was in his power to have choſen whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would have given it him or no; and that <hi>Jehoram</hi> had not the Kingdom by inheritance, or of right, but by his fathers gift: and the meaning is this, <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> with the Peoples conſent, beſtowed the Kingdom upon <hi>Jehoram</hi> his eldeſt ſon: for otherwiſe <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> had no power, either by the Law of God or Nature, to give the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> being ſuch a holy man and good Governour, had won the Peoples affections ſo much, that they were contented to grant his deſire that his eldeſt ſon ſhould ſucceed him. For if <hi>Jehoſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat</hi> ſhould have given away the Kingdom without the Peoples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, it had been wickedly and injuſtly done, and therefore I dare not entertain ſuch a thought of good <hi>Jehoſhaphat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other Inſtance is as void of proof. For if it ſhould be granted, that if the eldeſt Son had been living, or any of the elder Brethren, the People would have made the eldeſt King; yet it doth not follow they were bound to do ſo, or that it was the birthright of the eldeſt Son to ſucceed his Father. It is poſſible that the People might in an ordinary way ſet up the eldeſt Son in his Father's room, becauſe uſually the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt might be ſuppoſed to be the fitteſt for it, as having moſt knowledge and experience; and the Father commonly hath the greateſt love for his eldeſt Son, and would improve his intereſt in the Judges, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and Officers, as well as the People, for his eldeſt Son's ſucceſſion, and for other reaſons; but it will not follow hence that it was the Birthright of the eldeſt Son. And yet I do not remember that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth mention above one example of the eldeſt Son's ſucceeding the Father among all the Seed of <hi>David</hi> that ſate upon the Throne, and that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95245:9"/>
was <hi>Jehoram</hi> above mentioned, and he had the Kingdom by gift, not in his own right. And we find <hi>Solomon,</hi> a younger Brother, ſucceeding his Father: and <hi>Abijah,</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> ſeems to be a younger Brother, for the Scripture mentions elder ſons that <hi>Rehoboam</hi> had by another wife, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11.19, 20. but <hi>Rehoboam</hi> loved <hi>Maacah, Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah's</hi> mother, more than all his wives, and therefore improved his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to make him King. You ſee then, notwithſtanding theſe Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that the People have an undoubted right of making their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours according to the Law of God; and that there is no juſt or rightful title to the Government of Nations, without the conſent of the People.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Treating of the Qualifications of Magiſtrates, evincing by the Light of Reaſon, Law of God, End of Government, and other Arguments, that the People are bound to chuſe ſuch as are endued with the Spirit of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, wiſe and faithful men, fearing God, and hating Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to be Governours over them.</head>
               <p>I Have ſhewn you in the laſt Chapter, that by the Law of God and Nature, the People have an unqueſtionable right of making their Governours both ſupream and ſubordinate; I intend by the Lord's aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in this Chapter, to make it clear, That the People are bound to chuſe men endued with the Spirit of Government thereunto.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then, from the Light of Nature it is evident, that ſuch only ſhould be intruſted with the Government, as are endued with the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Government.</hi> Doth not Reaſon it ſelf teach men in all their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate concernments to entruſt the managing thereof with perſons fitly qualified? what wiſe man would commit the government of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily to an imprudent or unfaithful Steward? the education of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to an ignorant or negligent Schoolmaſter? the government of his Workmen in any kind of Manufacture, to one that wants diſcretion or honeſty? the care of a Flock of Sheep, to a careleſs or unskilful Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd? or put his Son Apprentice, to a Maſter that neither underſtands nor regards his Trade?</p>
               <p>Hath Nature taught us to be ſo cautious in theſe leſſer concernments, and careleſs of the greater? to intruſt none but ſuch as are able and faithful with any matters of leſſer moment, and to commit our Laws, Lives, Liberties, Relations, Eſtates and good-names to the truſt of ſuch,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95245:9"/>
of whoſe ability and integrity we have no evidence? All this is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>Is a negligent and careleſs perſon unfit to govern a few Boyes in a School, and yet ſuch a one fit to govern a Nation, whoſe number is as the ſand of the Sea? Is a faithleſs, prodigal, and diſhoneſt man unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be made a Steward of one Family, and yet ſuch a one fit to make a Steward for three Nations? Is one that makes no conſcience of his word, unfit to be truſted with the care of a flock of Sheep, and yet ſuch a one fit to be truſted with the care of the Laws, Lives, Liberties, Eſtates and Concernments of many millions of Men? Is a careleſs, faithleſs, deboiſt perſon, unfit to govern two or three Apprentices, and yet ſuch a one fit to govern Towns, Cities, Countries, yea, populous Nations themſelves? I appeal to any man, who hath but the leaſt ſpark of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in him, whether this be not highly irrational?</p>
               <p>And yet alas, how few are there to be found, among the multitude of men that inhabit this Nation, who are half ſo careful of the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier matters of Publick Concernment, as of the <hi>Aniſe, Mint</hi> and <hi>Cummin</hi> of their private affairs!</p>
               <p>Much like to a company of Paſſengers that are going to Sea, every one looks after his own Goods to ſecure them from dammage, but little regard what Pilot and Mariners they have; but when they are upon the Sea, woful experience convinceth them of their folly. Their Pilot is unskilful or negligent, their Mariners as bad; and now they begin to repent; O that we had been ſo wiſe as to have choſen a better Pilot and Mariners! but it is too late, he hath got them aboard, and there he keeps them, till at length through his folly or negligence he runs the Veſſel on the Sands, where many of them loſe their Goods and Lives together.</p>
               <p>What a Pilot and Mariners the multitude have choſen, woful expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath now taught them.</p>
               <p>O <hi>England,</hi> why ſleepeſt thou? 'tis high time to awake! Thy Pilot and Mariners eat, drink and make merry with thy ſadding, and have no regard to thee; the winds blow, the waves beat, the ſtorm encreaſes, thy Tackling is bad, thy Compaſs falſe, thou art very near the Rocks or Sands; and unleſs the Lord in mercy look upon thee, thou wilt be ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſplit or ſunk. If ever the Lord bring thee ſafe to harbour again, be wiſer for time to come, make choice of a better Pilot and Mariners for thy next Voyage.</p>
               <p>But let us ſee what Inſtances we can find from the <hi>very Heathens</hi> themſelves, who have acknowledged this, That men endued with the Spirit of Government are to be choſen thereunto.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:95245:10"/>
                  <hi>Pharoah</hi> could ſay this of <hi>Joſeph, Can we find ſuch a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is? Foraſmuch as there is none ſo wiſe and diſcreet as thou art, thou ſhalt be over mine houſe, and according to thy word ſhall all my people be ruled,</hi> Gen. 41.38, to 41. Mark here, what the Light of Nature and Reaſon dictates to a Heathen.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there are no men ſo fit for Government as thoſe in whom the Spirit of God is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the wiſeſt and diſcreeteſt men, and ſuch as have the Spirit of God, ought to be preferred to places of the higheſt Authority.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Magiſtrates are not to be choſen by their Honours or Riches but by their Vertues; not ſuch as have empty Titles of <hi>Knights, Lords, Dukes</hi> or the like, and a baſe ignoble ſpirit under it; but ſuch as are <hi>wiſe, diſcreet,</hi> and have the Spirit of God in them. No queſtion but <hi>Pharoah</hi> had Noblemen and Rich men enough to have preferred to that place, but the Light of Nature convinced him, that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was fitter than all they.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That lowneſs of condition, as to worldly things, is no juſt bar to hinder a wiſe diſcreet man, in whom the Spirit of God is, from the greateſt truſt in Government. <hi>Joſeph</hi> was a ſlave, ſold into <hi>Egypt,</hi> after that a priſoner caſt into a Dungeon, and yet for all this, the very <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> prefer this man above all the <hi>Noblemen</hi> in the Land.</p>
               <p>Object. It will be objected, <hi>This was an extraordinary caſe;</hi> Joſeph <hi>had skil in interpreting Dreams; there was an eminent Character ſet upon him by God, enough to convince any man that he was the fitteſt man for that truſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> The reaſon why <hi>Joſeph</hi> was advanced to that great Truſt, was not barely for his Interpretation of the Dream, but for the wiſe Counſel he gave thereupon: the Lord had not only ſhewed him the Dream, but the way how to preſerve the Land; the Counſel he gave, was rational and diſcreet, and pleaſed <hi>Pharoah</hi> and all his Servants, <hi>ver.</hi> 37. and becauſe he was a wiſe and diſcreet Counſellor, able to govern the Land better than any that was in it, therefore they choſe him: <hi>Joſephs</hi> skill in interpreting Dreams, would not have fitted him for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Egypt,</hi> without a Spirit of Counſel and Prudence to manage the weighty Affairs thereof. One gift doth not fit a man for every Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Pharoah</hi> by conference with him, found him to be a wiſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Counſellor, and therefore exalted him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Darius</hi> (though a <hi>Heathen</hi>) preferred <hi>Daniel</hi> above all the <hi>Preſidents</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> of the Empire, becauſe he had a more excellent Spirit than they, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.3. the Light of Nature taught him, that dignity was the juſt reward of Virtue; no queſtion but he had many thouſands in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions who excelled <hi>Daniel</hi> in greatneſs and riches; but <hi>Daniel</hi> excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95245:10"/>
them in Wiſdom and Goodneſs; <hi>Daniels</hi> Wiſdom and Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, out-weighed all their Titles and Treaſures, and was of more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the Empire. So that let a very <hi>Heathen</hi> be Judge, and he will tell you that thoſe who have the moſt excellent Spirits, ſhould be advanced to the higheſt Truſts in Government.</p>
               <p>Another Inſtance is that of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> another <hi>Heathen,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionates <hi>Ezra</hi> to make ſuch as knew the Law of God, <hi>Rulers</hi> over all the People beyond the River, <hi>Ezra</hi> 7.25. <hi>Oh what ſhame doth this ſpeak to</hi> England! where Men that are ignorant of, yea, that hate the Law of God, are every where made <hi>Rulers</hi> over others.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>Know</hi> (there uſed) is a Word of ſenſe, and ſignifies an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate Knowledge, ſuch a Knowledge as is accompanied with Love; it is a comprehenſive Word; it is as much as if he ſhould have ſaid, It is my reſolution to have the Law of thy God obſerved; I know thee to be a man full of Wiſdom, Zeal, and Faithfulneſs, to God and thy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and therefore I commit this weighty Affair to thee; look out ſuch men as have underſtanding in, love to, and zeal for the Law of thy God, and make them <hi>Rulers</hi> over the People beyond the River.</p>
               <p>In like manner <hi>Jethro,</hi> Prieſt (or rather Prince of <hi>Midian</hi> (for the word ſignifies both) adviſeth <hi>Moſes</hi> to provide out of all the People, <hi>able Men,</hi> ſuch as fear God, Men of truth, and hating Covetouſneſs, (four neceſſary Qualifications) and make them <hi>Rulers</hi> over the People. I do not find any ground from the Text, to conceive that <hi>Jethro</hi> gave this Counſel to <hi>Moſes</hi> by any ſpecial Revelation, but being a wiſe and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding man, he gave ſuch Counſel, as Reaſon it ſelf dictates to all men; which will appear plainly, if we weigh thoſe Qualifications <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thro</hi> mentions in the Ballance of Reaſon.</p>
               <p>For doth not Reaſon tell us, That men who are not able for an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, are not to be entruſted with it? That men of falſhood, who make no conſcience of their word or promiſe, are unworthy of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of others? That covetous, private-ſpirited men, who love money, and make haſt to be rich, are not fit to be truſted with the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Juſtice? is it likely that ſuch men will faithfully ſerve God and their Country, whoſe hearts run after Covetouſneſs? And if the light of Nature teach us that there is a God, it tells us that He is to be feared; and that <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> who are to govern others, ſhould in an eſpecial manner be ſuch as <hi>fear</hi> God themſelves: For if <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> have no fear of God, what opportunity have they to diſcountenance Virtue, and encourage Vice, and ſo bring down the wrath of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Land?</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Plato</hi> writes for a Government which he calls, <hi>Ariſtocracy;</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:95245:11"/>
that is, ſuch a form of Government where the beſt men are made Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours; and that muſt needs be the beſt Government where the beſt men bear rule.</p>
               <p>You ſee then how the Light of Nature and Reaſon doth inſtruct us to chuſe the wiſeſt and beſt men for Governours; and may not men be aſhamed and bluſh, to call themſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who are in practice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Heathens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh my native Country! what Lamentation ſhall I take up for thee? how are thy Foundations out of courſe? how art thou fallen from the Light of Nature, and Principles of Reaſon it ſelf? Who is that Man thou canſt produce among thy <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>Rulers,</hi> that may indeed be juſtly called a Man of Truth, and fearing God? Where is that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Spirit of true Wiſdom and Underſtanding to be found among thy <hi>Leaders?</hi> Are ſuch as have the Spirit of God and true Diſcretion, advanced to the Government? Is it not now become a Crime ſufficient to depoſe a Governour, to be a man that feareth God?</p>
               <p>O let it not be told in <hi>Egypt,</hi> nor publiſhed in the ſtreets of <hi>Media,</hi> that <hi>England</hi> turns men out of Government, becauſe the Spirit of God is in them, and they do excel in Virtue; let not the Prince of <hi>Median</hi> here how <hi>Jethro</hi>'s Counſel is rejected, and men that have no wiſdom, truth, or fear of God, made Rulers of the Land. Repent in time of thy tranſgreſſion of the very Law of Nature, while thou doſt profeſs the Goſpel, leſt <hi>Pharoah, Plato, and Darius,</hi> with all the wiſeſt of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> riſe up in judgement, and condemn thee; for they have judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the beſt of men, and ſuch as did excel in Virtue, worthy of greateſt Exaltation; but thou in midſt of Goſpel-Light, ladeſt them with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and ſcorn, and the wicked walk on every ſide while the vileſt men are exalted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It being evident from the Light of Reaſon, that men rightly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified with the Spirit of Government, are only fit to be entruſted with it. Let us enquire what the Law of God ſaith to this point, and certainly we ſhall find, that the Law of Nature and Scripture do moſt exactly agree as well in this as other things.</p>
               <p>The firſt Scripture I ſhall mention, is <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.14, to end, where there are ſeveral Qualifications required in him whom the People were to make King, either expreſly or implicitely.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He moſt be a <hi>Brother;</hi> which word is of a large extent, for it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports one of their own Country and Religion; they were not to ſet a ſtranger over them, that is a ſtranger in either: for the People of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> were Brethren, not only by Nation, but Religion, and it enjoyned them to ſet one over them who was a member of the Church of God;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95245:11"/>
and without doubt that was the principal reaſon for which this Rule was given, leſt if they ſhould have ſet any of the Idolatrous Kings of the Nations over them, he ſhould draw them to Idolatry: And ſurely it layes an Obligation upon Chriſtians and Proteſtants, to ſet one of their Brethren over them, not one who will bring in <hi>Popery, Superſtition,</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> into the Land.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lord tells the People, that the King whom they were to make, ſhould write a copy of his Law, and read therein all the dayes of his life, that he might learn to fear the Lord; which doth manifeſtly inſtruct the People, to ſet one over them who was capable of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Duties, and reſolved to obey the Command of God; for if the <hi>King</hi> muſt read all his dayes in the Law of God, and learn to keep all his Statutes; would not common Reaſon infer this, that the People who were to make a King, ſhould not make an ignorant perſon that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or a profane perſon, that were unwilling to ſtudy the Law of God? Indeed all the other duties which the Lord acquaints the People with beforehand, were ſo many directions for them to ſet up one qualified for thoſe duties; for if the King was not to multiply Silver or Gold to himſelf, ſurely this inſtructed the People not to make a <hi>covetous perſon</hi> King; if the <hi>King</hi> muſt not lift up himſelf above his Brethren, it taught them to make a humble, tender-hearted man King, not a proud domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering perſon, who would lord it over the Lord's Heritage, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave them: and ſo may be ſaid of all the other duties of the King; each duty of the King, is a direction to the People, to conſtitute one qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But this Law was given to Iſrael, how doth it appear it binds other Nations?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> By the nature of the Law it is moral, and ſo univerſal, and perpetual. There are indeed one or two Particulars that were peculiar to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> State. <hi>Firſt,</hi> They muſt ſet one over them whom the Lord ſhould chuſe, which implieed that God intends out of his eſpecial grace and favour to them (as his Church) to chuſe the man himſelf for them ſometimes, yet they were to make him King: but God doth not ſo for other Nations, but hath left us to chuſe for our ſelves, according to the Light of Reaſon and Scripture. Again, their King was not to ſend the People to <hi>Egypt,</hi> becauſe the Lord had forbid the People of Iſrael to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn thither any more; which our <hi>King</hi> may do upon a juſt occaſion; but the ſubſtance of the Law is of a moral nature, and obligeth all Kings and People whatſoever, That the King ſhould not multiply Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Gold, Wives, or Horſes to himſelf, and thereby impoveriſh the People, and ſuffer his heart to be drawn from God; that he ſhould have
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95245:12"/>
a copy of the Law of God, and read therein all the dayes of his life; learn to fear God, and keep his Statutes, and not lift up his heart above his Brethren, is all Moral, and doth oblige other Kings as well as the Kings of Iſrael.</p>
               <p>That a People profeſſing the true Religion, ſhould not ſet over them one of a ſtrange Religion, to bring in Idolatry and Falſe-worſhip (which was the intent of that clauſe, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſet a ſtranger over thee</hi>) That they ſhould take care to ſet up a man in the Throne, who is able and willing to perform the Duties God requires of a King, is all Moral, and obligeth the People of <hi>England,</hi> as much as it did the People of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next Scripture I ſhall produce for confirmation of this Truth, is 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.3. <hi>The God of Iſrael ſaid, the Rock of Iſrael ſpake to me, He that ruleth over men, muſt be juſt, ruling in the fear of God.</hi> You ſee here, the <hi>Rock of Iſrael</hi> hath appointed two great Qualifications in thoſe that rule over men; <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and the <hi>Fear of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Theſe places ſhew only the Magiſtrates duty, not any Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions neceſſary to the Office of a Magiſtrate; this proves that Magiſtrates are bound to obſerve thoſe duties, not that the People are bound to chuſe none but ſuch men as are juſt, and fear God, to be Governours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> The very ſame Sophiſtry do the wicked and ſcandalous Prieſts uſe to cheat the poor People withal, and lull them aſleep, that they may make a prey of them in the mean while.</p>
               <p>The Lord ſayes, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>A Biſhop or Overſeer</hi> (for ſo the word is in the Greek) <hi>muſt be blameleſs, vigilant, ſober, of good behaviour, apt to teach, not greedy of filthy lucre, not given to Wine, no ſtricker, but patient, not a brawler, nor covetous.</hi> The Prieſt is a proud, covetous, drunken, deboiſt perſon, and the poor People muſt be compelled to own him for a Miniſter of Chriſt, who hath never a Qualification of a true Miniſter in him: if they complain, we cannot own him for a true Miniſter; a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter muſt be thus and thus qualified, he is the contrary; they are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, O thoſe are indeed the Duties of a Miniſter, but not the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications neceſſary to the Being of a Miniſter; a man may be a true Miniſter if he be ordained, though he walk contrary to theſe Duties, and you are bound to own his Miniſtry nevertheleſs, becauſe it is an Ordinance of God.</p>
               <p>So in this caſe we cannot deny, ſay they, but a Magiſtrate ſhould be juſt, ruling in the fear of God, it's his duty ſo to do: but what if he be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, and caſt away the fear of God, he is a true Magiſtrate notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and you are bound in Conſcience to own his Authority as the Ordinance of God. By this kind of Sophiſtry the Devil maintains his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95245:12"/>
Kingdom, and the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and <hi>Falſe-Prophet</hi> theirs, to the utter ruin of the Bodies and Souls of men.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the two grand Cheats wherewith the World is abuſed, by wicked and <hi>unworthy perſons,</hi> pretending to Authority from God, to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern both <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> when they are utterly deſtitute of thoſe Qualifications God hath laid down for the election of perſons into thoſe Offices: and indeed it is hard to ſay, which is the greater cheat of the two. Bleſſed be God many diſcern the <hi>Cheat</hi> of an <hi>ignorant, proud, covetous</hi> and <hi>prophane Miniſtry,</hi> and will not own it for an Ordinance of God. I doubt not, through God's aſſiſtance, to make it evident to the World, that a <hi>wicked, tyrannous,</hi> and <hi>oppreſſing</hi> Magiſtracy, is no more Gods Ordinance than the other; and that the People are bound to reject both, and ſet up <hi>able men,</hi> Men of Truth, fearing God, and hating covetouſneſs, in the Magiſtracy as well as Miniſtry; and that all who are not thus qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, are but meer Counterfeits and Pretenders.</p>
               <p>For whereas theſe men pretend, that the Characters which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures give of true Magiſtrates and Miniſters, do only ſhew their duty, not any Qualifications that are neceſſary to the conſtitution of them; it is a meer falſity. For the Spirit of God hath on purpoſe laid down Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of a true Magiſtracy and Miniſtry, that the People who have the Power of electing both, put into their hands by God, ſhould not ſuffer his Ordinances to be prophaned, but chuſe Men after his heart for both functions of Magiſtracy and Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle commands <hi>Titus</hi> to ordain Elders in every City (that is Miniſters) but upon this condition, that there were any to be found that were qualified according to the mind of God, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.5, to 8. and layes down ſeveral Characters to ſignifie what Qualifications God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in Miniſters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If any be blameleſs,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo goes on with many Qualifications which you may read there; and whereas the Apoſtle bids <hi>Titus</hi> ordain Elders, he doth not mean <hi>Titus</hi> ſingly, but joyntly, with the conſent of the Church; as is intimated in that clauſe, <hi>As I have appointed thee.</hi> Now the Apoſtle would not appoint <hi>Titus</hi> to do otherwiſe than he himſelf did and the reſt of the Apoſtles; but it is plain that the People choſe their Officers, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.3, and 5 verſes, the whole multitude choſe <hi>Stephen</hi> and the reſt. So <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23. <hi>When they had ordained them Elders in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Church,</hi> 'tis in your Tranſlation; but learned <hi>Beza</hi> renders it thus, <hi>Communibus ſuffragis creantes eis Presbyteros;</hi> they made them Elders (or Miniſters) by common ſuffrage or conſent, the multitude gave their votes and choſe them, and then the Apoſtles confirmed them by Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Prayer; but this by the way. However they were to be made,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95245:13"/>
yet not without Miniſterial Qualifications; <hi>Titus</hi> and the People toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had no power to make an ignorant or ſcandalous man a Miniſter of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The very ſame doth the Scripture hold forth concerning Magiſtrates, that the People are to look out Men rightly qualified with magiſtratical Endowments, for the Office of Magiſtracy.</p>

               <p>Thus you ſee how the Law of God requires the People to look out men that are endowed with the ſpirit of Government, and to make them Rulers, and what Preſidents the Word of God hath left us of the ſame.</p>

               <p>Every Means ſhould be adequate to its End, ſuch as may be effectual to accompliſh the End it was appointed for. The End for which Magiſtrates were made, was, <hi>The Glory of God,</hi> and <hi>Good of the People,</hi> Magiſtrates are the Means for accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95245:14"/>
this end; and can it be conceived that perſons deſtitute of <hi>Wiſdom, Prudence, Faithfulneſs, Juſtice,</hi> or the <hi>fear of God,</hi> are qualified for this End?</p>
               <p>Will ſuch a one ever ſeek to <hi>Honour God</hi> in the Government, as hath no <hi>Love</hi> to him, or <hi>Fear</hi> of him? to encourage <hi>Virtue,</hi> who is himſelf a <hi>Slave to Vice?</hi> Will ſuch a one ſeek the <hi>Peoples Good</hi> who regards not his own? Is one that knows not, yea that hates the Law of God, fit to be entruſted with the execution thereof? Is a Drunken Magiſtrate a fit mean to reduce a People to Sobriety? A Profane Magiſtrate a mean to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Piety? When experience daily confirms the Truth of that,
<q>
                     <l>Regis ad exemplum, totus componitur Orbis;</l>
                     <l>The whole World follow the Example of their King?</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Is a Perfidious perſon who makes light of the violation of his Faith, a mean to promote Truth and Honeſty? if it be, it is <hi>per accidens,</hi> through the goodneſs of God, who brings good out of evil; and ſo I hope the Perfidiouſneſs of theſe Governours will be a warning to the People to chooſe more Faithful Conſcientious Men for time to come.</p>
               <p>The Heathens could ſay, <hi>Deus &amp; Natura nil faciunt fruſtra; God and Nature make nothing in vain:</hi> But that accurſed Opinion, <hi>That a Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Magiſtrate is Gods Ordinance,</hi> under a pretence and vizard of Peace and Quietneſs, doth even fly in the face of God himſelf, and charge him with ſetting up ſo great an Ordinance over all mankind, which is but a vain thing: For certainly that is in vain which is not able to accompliſh its End; ſo that to call a wicked Magiſtrate <hi>God's Ordinance,</hi> is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach our Maker.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Word,</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>ſhall not return unto me void, but ſhall accompliſh that which I pleaſe, and proſper in the thing whereunto I ſent it,</hi> Iſa. 55.11. <hi>Word,</hi> is not here to be reſtrained to the Word Preached, but is taken in a large ſence; <hi>my Word</hi> of Command, Promiſe Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>my Word</hi> of Conſolation, Commination, or Inſtitution of mine Ordinances, <hi>it ſhall all proſper in the thing whereto I ſent it. I appoint nothing that is not ſufficient for its End.</hi> Now the End of that Inſtitution of Magiſtracy, being the <hi>Glory of God, and Good of the People,</hi> in the <hi>praiſe of them that do well,</hi> and <hi>puniſhment of thoſe that do evil.</hi> A vile perſon is no more a mean for it, than a profane perſon is a mean for bringing <hi>Glory to God,</hi> and doing <hi>Good to the People</hi> in the Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But may not a wicked Miniſter or Magiſtrate be an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of good to others, though he be bad himſelf?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. He may accidentally. I have heard of a Natural Fool that hath been inſtrumental to convert a wicked man, but he was never the fitter to be made a Miniſter of Chriſt therefore. A wicked Ruler may
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95245:14"/>
accidentally be an Inſtrument of ſome good to a People, but this is not Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for the lawfulneſs of chooſing ſuch a one to the Government. Magiſtrates are called <hi>Healers,</hi> Iſa. 3.7. <hi>Leaders,</hi> Iſa. 9.16. It is poſſible an ignorant perſon may hit upon a Medicine to cure a dangerous diſtemper, but would any wiſe man chooſe him for his Phyſician ever the ſooner? A Fool &amp; Coward may poſſibly do a piece of good ſervice once, but is he therefore fit to be made a Leader? It is altogether as abſurd to affirm, <hi>That a wicked or unworthy perſon ſhould be made a Magiſtrate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. But where there is one wicked Magiſtrate that doth good for the People, there are twenty do miſchief. That now and then a wicked Magiſtrate doth good for the People, may be written among Wonders and Prodigies, not to perſwade us to chooſe ſuch a one again, but to admire and adore the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God, who brings good out of evil, and makes wicked men ſometimes become ſerviceable to him and his people, contrary to their own inclinations.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But if there be any wicked Magiſtrate who poſſibly doth ſome good, yet he doth a great deal more hurt, the evil outweighs the good.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In a word, That which makes any thing a Mean, is the proportion it bears to the End; if a thing be not adequate to the End 'tis no Mean. But a wicked and unworthy perſon, though he may do ſome good acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally in the Magiſtracy, or may have ſome property or other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, is not adequate to the End of Government. <hi>Nero, Vitellius, Caligula,</hi> the verieſt Monſters in the World, had ſome properties laudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; Yea the Devil himſelf hath ſomething of good; he hath Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and Faith, and other things good in themſelves; but a wicked man wants thoſe qualifications, of true Wiſdom, Faithfulneſs and the Fear of God, which might render him fit for accompliſhing the End for which Magiſtracy was inſtituted.</p>
               <p>O therefore, if you have any zeal for the Honour of God, ſhew it by ſtanding up for thoſe to be made Governours, who truly fear his holy Name, and will be careful of his glory.</p>
               <p>Or, do you wiſh your Own, your Childrens, or the Nations Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? then never give your Vote again for wicked Men to Rule the Land. You will acknowledge, that it is your duty in your places to promote the Glory of God, and Good of the Land of your Nativity; yea who is there that will not ſay, <hi>Such a man that would not be willing to do this, were unworthy to live?</hi> You ſee the Means for theſe Ends, 'tis by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing Wiſe and Faithful Men, that Fear God, and Hate Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to the Government. Reſolve if ever the Lord afford you an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to chooſe Governours again, to look out men ſo qualified that may anſwer the Ends of Magiſtracy. Never foſter up your ſelves with
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95245:15"/>
fond conceits, that you ſhall gather <hi>grapes</hi> of <hi>thorns,</hi> or <hi>figs</hi> of <hi>thiſtles,</hi> that wicked Magiſtrates will ever promote thoſe glorious ends of God's Ordinance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A fourth Argument to evince the truth of this, That none but ſuch as are endued with the Spirit of Government, are to be intruſted with it, is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the ſetting up men void of wiſdom, faithfulneſs, and the fear of God, in the Government, be the way to enact wicked-Laws; Then ſuch as are deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of thoſe qualifications are not to be ſet up. But the former is true; therefore the latter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That wicked Magiſtrates will one way or other, by force or fraud, or both, get wicked Statutes to be made, is evident by the Scripture, Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the Chronicles of all Nations. Thus the Lord complains of the wicked Kings of <hi>Iſrael, Ezek.</hi> 43.7, 8. that they prophaned his holy Name, by <hi>ſetting their poſts by his poſts, and their threſholds by his thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſholds, and the wall between him and them:</hi> and when once wicked Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes are enacted, woful experience hath taught the world how hard it is to get them repealed. The Lord complains how the Statutes of <hi>Omri</hi> were kept above an hundred and threeſcore years after his reign, <hi>Mica.</hi> 6.16. and the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> walked in the wicked Statutes of the Kings which they had made ſo long, till they were carried captives to <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.8.</p>
               <p>And had I time to mention all the wicked Statutes which have been made by means of the wicked Kings of this Nation, and are yet in force, it would make you ſtand amazed, to think how <hi>They,</hi> the <hi>Lawyers</hi> and <hi>Clergie</hi> together, have abuſed the poor People. But it would take up a Volumn to treat of this by it ſelf, and this Argument is ſo experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally underſtood at this day, that I need not enlarge upon it.</p>
               <p>What curſed Laws are now in force, to perſecute the faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt, for preaching to the People that they might be ſaved? to murder the Lord's People, by ſtifling them in Priſons and Dungeons? where hundreds have within theſe three years periſhed, for no other cauſe but <hi>praying, preaching,</hi> and <hi>hearing the Word of God;</hi> and all this, and much more, becauſe wicked men are put in authority. For had the People obeyed the Law of God, and choſen ſuch to rule as were juſt and fearing God, this would not have been.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A fifth Argument is this:
<q>If the chuſing men deſtitute of the Spirit of Government, be the way to make void the Law of God; Then none ſuch ſhould be choſen. But the former is true; therefore the latter.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:95245:15"/>As wicked Magiſtrates will enact wicked Laws of their own, ſo will they be ſure to reject and make void the Law of God. Why elſe do we ſee ſo many men pardoned for Murder, and walk at liberty up and down the ſtreets in the face of the Sun, who by the Law of God ſhould die? and the faithful Servants of God, and Friends of their Country, laid up in filthy Dungeons? How eaſie a thing is it for a Murderer (if he hath money) to get a Pardon? Some call it <hi>a Leaſe of Life,</hi> becauſe it is too groſs a thing to ſay <hi>a Pardon for Murder</hi> in plain terms.</p>
               <p>O how frequently have I ſeen that ſaying of the Philoſopher exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified in this Nation! <hi>The great Thieves lead the leſſer thieves to hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Publick Thieves who cheat the whole Nation of their Liberties, Eſtates, Birth-rights, and Goſpel-priviledges, under the titles of <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Juſtices,</hi> condemn and ſentence to death ſmall thieves, for ſuch faults as are not the hundredth part ſo heinous as their own? And yet the poor people believe the great Thieves are God's Ordinance, and worthy of all honour, but the leſſer thieves juſtly put to death. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as indeed, if Juſtice had its courſe, there were more reaſon why the little thieves ſhould condemn and execute the great Thieves.</p>
               <p>For it is the <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> of the Magiſtrates, which is the principal cauſe why there are ſo many Thieves in the Land. They lay intolerable Taxations on the People, and by their Tyranny deſtroy Trade, ſo that thouſands are conſtrained to lay down their Callings for want of work; they make ſuch intricate, tedious, and chargeable Laws, that are more like Inſtruments to pick the Peoples Pockets, than Rules of Righteouſneſs; invented by the ſubtil Lawyers for Gins to catch the People in, where they keep men ſo long as their money laſts, and then let them go; ſo that (for the moſt part) it fares with thoſe, that ſeek to the Lawyers and Witches for remedy, alike, they never thrive after. By theſe and many other Artifices or Myſteries of State, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates rob, ſpoil and impoveriſh the People, and reduce them to ſuch neceſſity, that while the Governours ſpend their money in pride, luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and all manner of voluptuouſneſs, they are forced to beg or ſteal; and many (being aſhamed to beg) fall to ſtealing for the neceſſity of their ſouls, but ſtealing without authority, are brought before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Rulers (who have a Charter to ſteal by Authority, and condemn all others who ſteal without licenſe from them) and ſentenced to death by thoſe, who much more deſerve it than themſelves.</p>
               <p>But alas, it were endleſs to recite the particular caſes, wherein theſe wicked Rulers violate the Law of God; for whereas the Law hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed puniſhment for evil-doers, and praiſe for them that do well, what do theſe but the very contrary? turning the Sword againſt ſuch as
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95245:16"/>
fear God, and obey his Law. So that we have juſt cauſe to plead with the Lord, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.126. <hi>It is time for thee, O Lord, to work, for they have made void thy Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Brethren, you cannot but acknowledge that the Law of God ſhould be put in execution, that it is great cauſe of lamentation, yea and holy indignation, to ſee the Law of God thus violated: and what wiſe man could expect any better from ſuch Rulers as theſe? it is impoſſible the Law of God ſhould be executed where wicked men are exalted.</p>
               <p>Magiſtrates are entruſted with the execution of God's Law, and if they do not underſtand, or affect it, they will never execute it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> (though a Heathen) ſhewed more wiſdom and prudence, than many eminent Profeſſors among us have lately done; for he would have <hi>Ezra</hi> to make ſuch men <hi>as knew the Law of God</hi> (that is, knew it affectionately, as underſtood and loved the Law of God) <hi>Magiſtrates and Judges over all the People beyond the River,</hi> Ezra 7.25. He knew that it was in vain to think of having the Law of God executed by ungodly Rulers.</p>
               <p>If we had the beſt Laws that ever any Nation under Heaven had, and wicked Magiſtrates to execute them, we ſhould have little advantage by them: they will find one way or other to wreſt and pervert the Law of God, in deſpite of the People. I thought to have urged other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the confirmation of this great and weighty Truth, <hi>That onely ſuch men as are endowed with the Spirit of Government, ſhould be entruſted with it;</hi> and to have ſhewn you how the ſetting up of men void of thoſe qualifications, which the Light of Reaſon and Law of God requires in Magiſtrates, is the way to extirpate Virtue out of the Land, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce all manner of Vice, and to bring down the Judgments of God upon us; but in regard we find it by ſad experience, that this wicked Generation are no other than a mighty flood of Superſtition and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſs, a ſweeping rain of Oppreſſion, an Army of Locuſts eating up every green thing, I ſhall forbear to enlarge any more upon this Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, but cloſe this Chapter with a word of Exhortation, and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the next.</p>
               <p>You ſee what Power the Lord hath entruſted the People withal, that the Right of making their Governours belongs to them, yea, that it is not onely their Priviledge, but Duty, by the Law of God, to ſet Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates over them, both Supream and Subordinate; you ſee alſo what Qualifications the Law of God requires the People to look after in ſuch as they entruſt with Government; they muſt be Wiſe, Prudent, Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Perſons, that have given Proof of their Integrity; Men of Truth, that underſtand the Law of God, Fearing God, and Hating Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:95245:16"/>O that I might prevail with every one that reads this, to reſolve, that if ever they have an opportunity to give their Suffrage for the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Magiſtrates again, they will lay aſide all by-reſpects and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal intereſts whatſoever, and give their Voice for none but ſuch as are endued with the Spirit of Government, and with thoſe due Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which the Law of God requires. How frequent is it for men to give their Voice for thoſe of their own Judgement or Party, though al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together deſtitute of that Excellent Spirit which makes men meet for the Truſt they are choſen to? How common to adhere to their Kindred, Landlords, or Benefactors, and improve all their Intereſt for ſuch a one who hath neither Wiſdom, Faithfulneſs, Fear of God, nor Love to his Country? Alas! How rare a thing is it to hear of one choſen for his Virtues? The ſound of a great Name, and glittering ſhew of phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Apparel, is that which qualifies a man for Government, in the judgement of the multitude. 'Tis not what Virtues, but what Titles a man hath. When a hundred men better qualified for Magiſtracy are paſſed by, a Knight, or a Lord ſhall be choſen for his Airy Titles ſake; which is juſt as if a man ſhould refuſe a Shield of Braſs, becauſe it were not finely painted, and chooſe a Paper Eſcutcheon (bearing ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Armes) for his ſhield to defend him; for Magiſtrates are the Shields of the Earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 47.9.</p>
               <p>O <hi>England,</hi> be not ſtill ſo froward as to put away proſperity from thy ſelf, by chooſing ſuch for thy Governours as are void of thoſe Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which the Law of Nature and Scripture doth require. Never wilt thou enjoy a ſolid, laſting Peace, until thou embrace Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.16, to 19. Never will Righteouſneſs be executed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs righteous men be made Governours. If ever thou art Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, theſe muſt be thy Healers. If ever thy Breaches be made up, theſe muſt be the Repairers. O take that Counſel of <hi>Jethro,</hi> Exod. 18.21. <hi>Look out from among thy People, able men, ſuch as fear God, men of truth, hating covetouſneſs, and make them Rulers. If thou ſhalt do this thing, then ſhall all thy People go to their place in Peace,</hi> Verſ. 23.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Treating of the Magiſtrates relation, wherein is proved, both by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and Reaſon, that Magiſtrates from the higheſt to the loweſt, are the Peoples Servants. Such Objections as may probably be made againſt that Aſſertion, anſwered, and a few Inferences deduced from it.</head>
               <p>I Come to the Relation in which Magiſtrates ſtand to the People, and I doubt not through the Lords aſſiſtance to make it manifeſt, that the fond conceit which the flattering Lawyers and Prelates have infuſed into the ignorant multitude, of the Sacredneſs and Unaccountableneſs of the King, is altogether inconſiſtent with his relation. And becauſe that 13th <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Romans</hi> is ſo much pleaded by the Advocates of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, I ſhall begin with that. The Relation of the Magiſtrate, is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly held forth by the Title which the Spirit of God gives him in that <hi>Chapter,</hi> and that is, <hi>A Publick Servant,</hi> whereas it is tranſlated <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> in the plaineſt term it is <hi>Servant, Rom.</hi> 13.4.6.</p>
               <p>The word tranſlated <hi>Miniſter,</hi> verſ. 4. is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and is derived from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in <hi>pulvere deſudare.</hi> It ſignifies (ſaith <hi>Pareus) a painful and laborious ſervice, like thoſe that by hard travel raiſe the duſt with their feet.</hi> And as it ſignifies a laborious, ſo many times a low ſervice in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of many others, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.1. <hi>Phebe</hi> a woman, is called <hi>Servant</hi> of the Church at <hi>Cenchrea.</hi> The Women are ſaid to miniſter unto Chriſt, and the company in the houſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.15. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.55. So <hi>John</hi> 12.2. <hi>Martha</hi> ſerved, that is, ſhe waited at Table; in all theſe places, the ſame Word is uſed, and ſignifies a mean ſervice, and indeed the ſervice which this word doth properly ſignifie, is a <hi>Service in the Duſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that that word imports a painful and humble Service. The other word, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. tranſlated <hi>Miniſters,</hi> ſhould have been tranſlated, <hi>Publick Servants;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; it is derived from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>opus; publick Workmen</hi> or <hi>Servants.</hi> The Magiſtrate hath his name not from Idleneſs, but <hi>painfulneſs.</hi> The word is ſometims applied to a mean ſervice as 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.18. <hi>Amnons</hi> Servant: The <hi>Septuagent</hi> renders it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and <hi>Illiricus</hi> in his <hi>Clavis Scriptura,</hi> ſayes that the word doth moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſignifie a Service that is laborious. And it is applyed to <hi>Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroditus, Phil.</hi> 2.15. a Meſſenger that carried the Churches relief to <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:95245:17"/>You ſee then what a Magiſtrate is by the Titles the Spirit of God gives him, <hi>A publick and painful Servant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Queſtion will be to whom is the Magiſtrate Servant; none will deny but he is the Servant of God, but few underſtand what he is to the People in general, and to themſelves in particular, as members of the whole; know then, that he is a <hi>Servant Of God,</hi> and <hi>To thee, Rom.</hi> 13.4. The Relation of the Magiſtrate is in thoſe words, briefly, fully, and clearly held out. Obſerve; the Apoſtle doth not ſay, he is a Servant of God for thy good; but to make it plain that he is a Servant to the People alſo, he ſaith he is a Servant <hi>Of God To thee for good:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by moſt excellently repreſenting, not only the End of Magiſtrates, in thoſe words, <hi>For good;</hi> but alſo the relation they ſtand in, both to God and the People, in thoſe words, he is a Servant <hi>Of God, To thee;</hi> and though this may (perhaps) ſeem ſtrange to ſome, that the Magiſtrate ſhould be a Servant to the People in general, and themſelves in particular; yet this Scripture doth not go alone, but there are more than two witneſſes to confirm it, although one Scripture is a ſufficient proof in it ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God, who is the author of it, cannot lye. I ſhall therefore mention ſome other Scriptures for confirmation of it, <hi>Acts.</hi> 13.36. It is ſaid that <hi>David</hi> King of Iſrael, <hi>Served his Generation.</hi> The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, a Service full of labour and care, it is a metaphor taken from thoſe perſons that work at the Oars, and is ſubſtantially applyed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inferior Servants of the Commonwealth; as <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.25. <hi>leſt the Judge deliver thee to the Officer;</hi> that is, the <hi>Jailor,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. So <hi>Mark</hi> 14.65. the Servants ſtrook Chriſt; that is, the inferior Officers that atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Court: and without doubt, a King is as truly a Servant to the Commonwealth, as a Jailor, Bayliff, or any other publick Servant; and therefore hath the Spirit of God applyed the ſame expreſſion to him as he hath to them.</p>
               <p>And if we read <hi>Davids</hi> behaviour to the People, we ſhall find that he well underſtood and kept his relation of Servant to them; for when he had made an unadviſed reſolution to go out in perſon, and leave the City (which was neither ſafe for him nor them) they tell him plainly, that <hi>he ſhall not go forth;</hi> whereupon the King ſubmitted to them, with this humble anſwer, which well became the Peoples Servant, <hi>That which ſeemeth you beſt will I do;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, it ſeems beſt to me to go in perſon, and I had fully reſolved it; but you ſay it is better for me to ſuccor you out of the City; I ſubmit my Judgement to yours, and my Will to yours, and <hi>that which ſeems beſt to you will I do,</hi> 2 Sam. 18.1, to 6. So when he had a deſire to bring the Ark of God back again in a publick manner, he asks the Peoples conſent firſt,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95245:18"/>
                  <hi>David ſaid unto all the Congregation, If it ſeem good unto you, let us ſend,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Chron. 13.2. And indeed common reaſon will tell us, that it is fitter one man ſhould ſubmit to the Judgement of many thouſands (I mean in things lawful) rather than they to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rehoboams</hi> wiſe Counſellors, the old men that had ſtood before his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, were not ignorant of this; they knew the King was the Peoples Servant, and therefore they perſwaded him, to acknowledge himſelf to be the Peoples Servant, and promiſe to <hi>Serve them,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.7. and that was the way to eſtabliſh his Throne; but the young Courtiers (like our Feather-men) could not endure to hear of this; they tell him 'tis a diſhonour to a King to be Servant to the People, and counſel him to ſtand up for a lawleſs Prerogative, and to daunt the People with threatnings; but alas it was in vain; the People underſtood their Priviledges and Liberties, yea, and duty alſo, too well to be fooled out of all by great words; if he will not ſubmit to their juſt demands, and do what ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good to them, as <hi>David</hi> did, and be a Servant to them for their good, he ſhall not be their Lord to their hurt, to vaſſalize and enſlave them; they rejected him and his Government, and choſe another in his ſtead. The adviſe which the old Counſellors gave him, was rational &amp; ſincere, and is recorded to their honour; they were worthy Patriots of their Country, and Aſſertors of the Law of God, and Liberties of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, againſt unlimitted Prerogative, and arbitrary Power; they perſwade the King to know his place, and be humble; if thou wilt be their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and not to diſſemble with the People, promiſe one thing, and mean another; and therefore they add, <hi>And wilt ſerve them;</hi> as if they ſhould have ſaid, if thou wilt promiſe them to be their Servant, and perform thy promiſe to them, and wilt indeed be their Servant; and by rejecting that adviſe, <hi>Rehoboam left the Kingdom of Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was <hi>Saul's</hi> plea, when he had diſobeyed God in ſparing <hi>Agag,</hi> and the chief of the Cattle; <hi>I obeyed the voice of the People,</hi> 1 Sam. 15.4. as if he ſhould have ſaid; I am the Peoples Servant, and muſt obey them, I was afraid to diſobey the People. I know this was no excuſe for <hi>Saul,</hi> neither did it juſtifie the action, becauſe he had an expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from God to deſtroy them utterly.</p>
               <p>And therefore, if the greateſt part of the People had been unwilling to have <hi>Agag</hi> killed, yet he ſhould have obeyed God rather than man; but it ſhews that <hi>Saul</hi> knew the People to be above him, and that it was his duty to obey them in any lawful command; and therefore he would have excuſed his diſobedience to the Command of God by his obedience to the People.</p>
               <p>In like manner <hi>Ahab</hi> (though a wicked man) was ſo obſervant of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95245:18"/>
People, that he would not preſume to give an anſwer to <hi>Ben-hadad,</hi> about a matter of publick concernment, till the People had appointed him what to ſay; and when the People had forbid him to conſent unto <hi>Ben-hadad</hi>'s demands, <hi>he obeys their voice,</hi> and returns this anſwer to <hi>Ben-hadad, I may not do it,</hi> 1 Kings 20.8, 9. As if he ſhould have ſaid, the people have forbid me to conſent unto thy demands, and I may not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey them; I am their Servant; the Silver and Gold thou ſendeſt for, is mine no otherwiſe than as a Truſtee of the People, to employ it in their Service, and for their good; and I muſt not diſpoſe of it without their conſent. <hi>Ahab</hi> who had ſold himſelf to do wickedneſs, had not yet arrived to that degree of unrighteouſneſs, as to pretend an abſolute Prerogative to do what he would; or that the People had no coercive power over him; for he confeſſes he may not do that, which the People (in the vindication of their own rights) forbid him to do. You ſee then, how clearly the Scripture makes good this Aſſertion, That Magiſtrates (yea the very higheſt of all) are publick Servants to the People. Let us enquire a little into Reaſon, and ſee what that ſayes unto it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then, do not the People make, conſtitute, and authorize Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates? whence have they their Call unleſs from the People? from God by any immediate Call, as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> or in an extraordinary manner, by a Prophet, as <hi>Saul, David, Jehu?</hi> This they dare not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to. From Nature? let them prove it if they can; as ſoon may they turn the Day into Night, and Ocean into dry Land, as prove any right to Government, by Nature, inherent in one family, as I have ſhewed before. By conqueſt? And ſo hath every Rogue in the World, that is able to get a company of theeves together, and forcibly take away my Poſſeſſion, and lead me captive, a right to govern over me. There's no other right to Government, either by the Law of God or Nature, but the Peoples choice; and therefore needs muſt they be Servants unto thoſe who give them their power.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If they were not the Peoples Servants, why do the People main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them, and pay them their wages? Is it not from the Peoples purſe the Magiſtrate is maintained? I need not uſe many words in this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, you know it by experience. <hi>Why</hi> (ſaith <hi>Cryſoſtome) do we give Tribute to the King? is it not the wages of his care for our protection?</hi> Since then, the Magiſtrate hath his Power and Wages from us, what ſhould he be (in reaſon) but our Servant?</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

                     </gap> is it not his due? how then can we be ſaid to give it him?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sol. Anſwer.</hi> It is his due no otherwiſe, than as he is a publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to us, and is by us entruſted with the care of our common ſafety, and ſo becomes due Wages for the work he doth us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:95245:19"/>Object. <hi>But if Magiſtrates be the Peoples Servants, why then are they called the Higher Powers, and every ſoul commanded to be ſubject to them,</hi> Rom. 13.1. <hi>and obey them?</hi> Titus 3.1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> This is meant of our ſingle capacity, not of our collective. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man may be conſidered ſingly, or as one particular perſon; and ſo every particular perſon in his ſingle capacity, is inferior to the King, and to be ſubject to, and obey him, in the execution of his Office: but a man may be conſidered conjunctively, or, as he is in union with the Commonwealth, and a part of that whole; and in this reſpect the Magiſtrate is inferior to us; as we are all united together, and make up one Commonwealth: for we, that is, all particulars joyning together, give the King that power, which afterwards, as private perſons, we are ſubject unto; and are ſubject to him no otherwiſe than as the publick Servant, which we have made, and do maintain at our charges, paying him his wages for the Service he doth us; we are ſubject to him not as our Maſter, but as our own Servant. The King is <hi>Superior ſingulis,</hi> but <hi>Inferior Univerſis;</hi> Superior to us as ſingle perſons, but Inferior to us as we are a Commonwealth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas ſome would reſtrain this, only to the King or chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, there is not the leaſt ground for any ſuch reſtriction; for as well the Subordinate as Supream Magiſtrates, are over us in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places and degrees, and we are as much bound to obey <hi>Judges, Mayors, Bailiffs,</hi> in the execution of that truſt which the People have repoſed in them, as the King; and yet we do not think a Mayor or Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff to be above the Community that choſe him; and the word tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>higher, Rom.</hi> 13.1. (where the Apoſtle ſpeaks of higher Powers) is attributed to all other Magiſtrates as well as the King, <gap reason="foreign">

And it is the very ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Magiſtrates, for the Relation of Magiſtrates and Miniſters in the general, is one and the ſame, they are both Servants to the People, though in a different kind of Service.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But are not Magiſtrates called Gods? How then can they be the Peoples Servants?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> That is a Metaphorical Expreſſion, ſpoken not by way of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, but Reſemblance; we know Magiſtrates are not properly gods, it were blaſphemy to ſay ſo; the names or attributes of God cannot without blaſphemy be given to them; it were blaſphemy to call a King

               <p>For when a Magiſtrate is a terror to evil works, and a praiſe to good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.3. he is a Servant to the People <hi>for good, ver.</hi> 4. and in this ſervice of his, he repreſents the juſtice of God, <hi>who rewards every man according to his works.</hi> We muſt beware of ſtraining Metaphors; the proper title of the Magiſtrate, which deſcribes his relation, is a Servant <hi>Of</hi> God <hi>To</hi> the People. The Metaphorical Title of God deſcribes his Virtues and Duties; the Wiſdom, Faithfulneſs and Juſtice which a true Magiſtrate is indued with, and rules in; and the proper and meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical Titles are not repugnant to each other: but this obſerve by the way, that he that is deſtitute of thoſe Virtues, or neglecteth thoſe Duties, wherein a true Magiſtrate reſembleth God, may be more juſtly called a Devil than a God, becauſe he reſembleth the Devil more than God. If it be ſaid that an unrighteous Magiſtrate, by reaſon of his great power and external glory, reſembleth God. I anſwer, <hi>It is falſe;</hi> for God hath no unrighteous or oppreſſive power; neither hath given any ſuch to Magiſtrates; and therefore there is no reſemblance between the power of a <hi>Tyrant</hi> or <hi>Oppreſſor,</hi> and the Power of the <hi>Moſt Juſt</hi> and <hi>Righteous Jehovah.</hi> The ſame I ſay of his external Glory; for the Glory of God is in his Wiſdom, Juſtice, Faithfulneſs, and other attributes, and the Works of Goodneſs, Mercy and Righteouſneſs which he doth; which the outward powers and ſplendor of an unrighteous Magiſtrate doth no way reſemble; but it doth moſt aptly reſemble the power and glory of the Devil, <hi>whoſe Servant he is, and whoſe works he doth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But if the King be the Peoples Servant, why is it that we read ſo often in Scripture, that the People were uſed to ſalute the King with this Title, My Lord the King? and ſay they were his Servants?</hi>

                  </gap> So the <hi>Levite</hi> (in a way of courteſie) ſayes to the old man that came from his work out of the field, <hi>Thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> Judg. 19.19. It is uſed ſo, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.10. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 1.13. and Chap.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95245:20"/>
2.6. And ſo it is to be underſtood when we read the People call the King <hi>My Lord,</hi> and ſay they are his Servants, it is an expreſſion of courteſie, not that they are in a ſtrict and proper ſence, and in point of duty, his Servants, or the King their Lord, for it is nothing ſo. Thus we read, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.4. the People come and tender their Service to <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> upon condition that he would eaſe them of their burdens; they came with reſpectful, courteous language unto him, and thought to win him thereby; but when he refuſed to perform his duty to them, they make him know, that in a ſtrict and proper ſence, they were his Maſters, and could puniſh him for his faults, and did deprive him of his Crown, <hi>ver.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>And ſo the Parliaments of <hi>England,</hi> and often the People without the Parliament, have (in their Addreſſes to the King) given him the Title of <hi>Lord,</hi> in a way of honour and reſpect; but when he hath refuſed to perform his duty to them, and endeavoured by his unlawful Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, to abridge them of their Liberties, they have made him underſtand his Relation, and by force of Arms aſſerted their own Priviledges, and ſometimes compelled the King to perform his duty, other times depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him from the Government; as the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did <hi>Rehoboam</hi> upon the ſame account; and ſo have moſt, if not all, the Nations in the World done the ſame.</p>
               <p>How common a thing is it in our ordinary Salutations, to ſay we are ſuch a ones Servant, in a general and reſpective ſence, and in point of courteſie, whoſe Servant we are not in a ſtrict ſence, and point of duty?</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But why may not Princes be Lords over the People, as well as Maſters Lords over their Servants, for the word tranſlated Maſter,</hi> Epheſ. 6.5. Col. 3.22. <hi>ſignifies Lord?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. Becauſe the Servant is inferiour to his Maſter, and by his place obliged to ſerve his Maſter; but here it is the contrary, for the Magiſtrate is inferiour to the Commonwealth, becauſe he is made by, and for them, and his Office (as I have ſhewed before) is to be a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to the People.</hi> Now a man cannot be in one and the ſame reſpect Lord and Servant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Maſter pays the Servant his wages, ſo doth not the Magiſtrate the People, but the People pay him his wages. So that this Objection is juſtly retorted upon thoſe that urge it, and in ſtead of proving the Magiſtrate to be the Lord, and the People to be Servants, proves the contrary; that the Magiſtrate is the Servant, and the People Maſters. Which not only the Philoſophers and wiſe ſort of the Heathens under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; but many of the greateſt Emperors in the World have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Tiberius Caeſar,</hi> who ſucceeded him in the Empire, (of whom we read <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.1) forbid any man to call him <hi>Lord,</hi> and took it as a reproach caſt upon him, for any one to call him ſo. And in an Oration he made to the People he uſeth theſe words, <hi>I have often, &amp; do ſtill afirm, that a good and virtuous Prince, whom you have entruſted with ſo great and large authority, ought to ſerve the Senate, and all the Citizens often, and many times particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſons, neither do I repent of what I have ſaid. And I have acknowledged you for my very good and favourable Lords, and do ſtill acknowledge the ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee the greateſt Emperors of the world confeſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be the Peoples Servants, and the People their Lords or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
               <p>The ſame in effect did <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperor confeſs, that he was infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the People; for when the <hi>Praetor</hi> delivered him the Sword at his Inauguration, he returned it to him again with theſe words: <hi>Take this Sword, uſe it for me, if I do that which is good; but if otherwiſe, againſt me; and that ſo much the more, becauſe it is the more wicked for one that Rules over all, to tranſgreſs the Law himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was far from pretending to impunity, that his perſon was Sacred, and muſt not be touched whatſoever wickedneſs he committed; but like a wiſe man and good Governour, he reſolved to do nothing worthy of puniſhment, or if he did, he ſubmitted himſelf to the ſtroak of the Sword, as much as any other perſon was to do; and it is obſervable that it was not for want of power he ſpake this, for the Empire was then at the <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>I could quickly tire both my ſelf and you with Teſtimonies of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from Philoſophers, Orators, and others, but I know the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any man is no proof, and I have given ſufficient proof from Scripture and Reaſon already, and therefore I ſhall not fill up my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers with tranſcribing other mens judgements, but mention one or two places worthy our conſideration out of the new Teſtament, which are the Teſtimony of Chriſt himſelf, and <hi>Paul</hi> his Apoſtle, and with a few Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences from the whole cloſe up this Chapter.</p>
               <p>The firſt is that of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.25. to 28. <hi>The Princes of the Gentiles exerciſe Dominion over them, and they that are great exerciſe Authority over them; but it ſhall not be ſo among you: but whoſoever will be great among you let him be your Seavant; And whoſoever will be chief among
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95245:21"/>
you, let him be your Servant.</hi> This Text holds out theſe things following.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there were two great political Evils among the Gentiles.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Their Princes lorded it, or exerciſed Dominion over them, they would not keep within the bounds of their relation, which God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had ſet out to Governours, to be Servants to the People; but they would be Lords over them, whoſe Servants they were in right. And therefore it is that Chriſt uſeth the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>they exerciſe Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip againſt them;</hi> as much as to ſay, their Lordſhip is againſt the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties</hi> and <hi>Priviledges</hi> of the People, againſt the <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Benefit</hi> of them whom they Govern; Their Prerogatives abrogate the Peoples Rights.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The great men exerciſe Authority over them, not the wiſe men or the good men, who were beſt qualified for Government, but thoſe who had great titles and riches were Rulers over them which was contrary to the Light of Nature, which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were endued withal, as I have ſhewed at large under the qualifications of Magiſtrates. Governours were not choſen for their Virtues or Goodneſs, but for their Greatneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Both theſe evils are forbid among Chriſtians. <hi>It ſhall not be ſo among you.</hi> You that will be my followers ſhall not imitate the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed manners of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Your Princes ſhall not be Lords over you, they ſhall not exerciſe <hi>Lordſhip</hi> againſt the Liberties and Priviledges of their Brethren. <hi>But whoſoever will be chief among you,</hi> (which muſt be the chief Magiſtrate, unleſs you will allow any other above him) <hi>let him be your ſervant.</hi> They that are great ſhall not exerciſe authority among you, but they that are Wiſe, Good, and Faithful men, ſuch as fear God and hate Covetouſneſs; you ſhall not chooſe men to Govern for their Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſake, but for their Goodneſs.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But is not this place to be underſtood onely of Miniſters, that they are not to be Lords over the People?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> There is no reaſon for ſuch a reſtriction, for the ſame evil that was practiſed by the <hi>Gentiles</hi> is forbid among Chriſtians. <hi>It ſhall not be SO among you.</hi> How was it among the <hi>Gentiles?</hi> He doth not ſay their Prieſts, but their Princes lorded it over them, <hi>But it ſhall not be SO among you,</hi> your Princes ſhall not do ſo. Chriſt knew well enough that his Church would encreaſe, and many millions own his Goſpel, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore carefully laies down Rules beforehand, how the Princes of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſhould behave themſelves.</p>
               <p>Again; our Saviour puts it in the moſt comprehenſive terms imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, <hi>Whoſoever will be chief among you, let him be your ſervant;</hi> be he who he will that is chief, he is but your ſervant at higheſt. And Chriſt allows of a chief Magiſtrate, but the Goſpel knows no chief Miniſter. For though <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.5. he was not behind the <hi>very chief of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95245:21"/>
the Apoſtles;</hi> he means not that any Apoſtle was by his Office above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but chief in <hi>labours</hi> and <hi>gifts;</hi> and ſo ſome might exceed others. And in regard this Precept is ſo conſonant to the Light of Reaſon, Law of God, and that of <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. where the Magiſtrate is called, <hi>A Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to the People,</hi> I wonder any ſhould go to reſtrain it onely to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, it being given in ſuch extenſive univerſal terms.</p>
               <p>Another place like to this, is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5, 6. <hi>There are many that are called gods, and lords: but to us there is but one God, the Father; and one Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, there are indeed among the Heathens many gods, they live in Idolatry; but we Chriſtians own but <hi>One God.</hi> Many of the Gentiles are ſo vain-glorious, that they will have earthly Lords, but we Chriſtians own none for our Lord, but <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> that is, no titular Lords, ſuch as exerciſe lordſhip over the People.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then, <hi>A Word to chief Magiſtrates, Kings, Princes, &amp;c.</hi> Learn to know your ſelves, your places and relations. Alas how few of you that wear Crowns and ſway Scepters underſtand your relation? and he is like to rule well that knows not his place. Beware of thoſe flattering and covetous Prieſts and Lawyers, who will ſay any thing for advantage, and flatter you out of your own reaſon. The Word of God, Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and your own Reaſon (if you have not loſt it) will tell you that you are Publick Servants to the People, who gave you your Power, and pay you your Wages. For ſhame make no more pretences to a Lordly Power over the People, whoſe Servants ye are: talk no more of your Lordſhips, unleſs you mean to declare your ſelves Tyrants. Rulers, chief Magiſtrates, we own, but not to be our Lords, but Servants, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Word of God.</p>
               <p>You know no other name to call the People by but <hi>Subjects;</hi> the Law of God will teach you a better name, to call them <hi>Brethren,</hi> and not to lift up your hearts in a lordly manner above your Brethren. This was the appellation <hi>David</hi> uſed to give the People, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.12. And the Lord commands proud <hi>Rehoboam</hi> to own the People for his Brethren, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.24.</p>
               <p>You call your ſelves <hi>Chriſtian Kings,</hi> and <hi>Defenders of the Faith,</hi> but like the Princes of the Gentiles, you exerciſe Lordſhip over the People, and againſt their Liberties. Yea, herein you are worſe than Gentile Princes; for they lorded it over Men, but you lord it over Saints, the true Nobles of the King of Heaven, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.4. You ſay you are the Chief, know then you are the <hi>Peoples Servants,</hi> Matth. 20.27. How dare you force the free-born People of this Land to ſwear that you are their Lords, when the Word of God ſayes expreſly you are their
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95245:22"/>
Servants? How much better would it become you to be humble and reſpective to the People, and acknowledge them for your good and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Lords, as that great Emperour did? than to be ſo haughty as you are? as if the People were your ſlaves, when in the mean while you live upon the Wages they give you, and are Stipendiaries unto them. A Servant honoureth his Maſter, you are the Peoples Servants, and ought to honour them. You are not ignorant, I ſuppoſe, of that cuſtom of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours to reverence and adore the People.</p>
               <p>How little do you mind your duty to the People? what is the ſervice you do them for the wages you receive, unleſs it be to make them ſlaves to your luſts? Let humble <hi>David</hi> be your pattern, who ſaid unto the People, <hi>That which ſeems beſt unto you will I do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A Word to ſubordinate Magiſtrates and Officers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Are Kings themſelves the Peoples Servants, and muſt you be Lords? What inſolent and abſurd behaviour have I ſeen at the Courts of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Judicature, from Judges, Juſtices, yea inferiour Clerks themſelves? what malepert and ſaucy language will they give to men, whoſe cloaks they are ſcarce worthy to carry? <hi>Sirrah, Knave,</hi> and the like, to thoſe whoſe ſervants they are, and whom they ought to honour. But alas, what is this to deeds? what are you, for the greateſt part, but very Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillars and devourers of the Land? Is this your ſervice to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to eat them up as one would eat bread, and make a prey of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters? And you Conſtables and other Officers, who hale men up and down to Priſons for conſcience ſake, becauſe they do what God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them; that beat, wound, yea kill men, who are peaceably aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, to ſeek the Lord, and build up one anothers ſouls: Is this your faithful ſervice to God and the People? you were appointed by the Lord to ſerve the People for their good, is this the good you do them?</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, <hi>We are commanded by the King, and we muſt do it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, <hi>Whether better to obey God or man, judge ye?</hi> The King commands you; and what, is his Command to ſtand againſt God's? God hath ſaid, <hi>That which is altogether Juſt ſhalt thou do,</hi> Deut. 16.20. And will you do that which is unjuſt, becauſe the King commands you? it ſhews you fear him more than God. The King is the People Servants as well as you, and will you abuſe your Brethren becauſe their Servant bids you? <hi>Pharaoh</hi> commanded the Midwives to kill the male Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.16. but the Midwives feared God, and did not as the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> commanded them, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. If you had the fear of God, that would teach you not to hale men to Priſon, where they are kept till they are ſtiſled to death, becauſe a wicked King commands you. <hi>Saul</hi> bid his Foot-men kill the Prieſts, but the Foot-men would not put forth
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95245:22"/>
their hand to fall upon them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.17. You that are Conſtables and other Officers, are you not aſhamed to be more baſe and ſlaviſh than <hi>Saul</hi>'s Foot-men? Well, know aſſuredly, that the righteous Judge will call you to an account for the injury you have done in this kind, and perhaps the People too, before you are either willing or aware.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>A Word to the People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Are Magiſtrates your ſervants? then learn to be wiſe, and know your Priviledges for time to come, and be not frighted out of your Right and Reaſon at once, by thoſe Traitors and Rebels, who would make you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that it is Treaſon and Rebellion, to call them to account for the <hi>Treaſon</hi> and <hi>Rebellion</hi> they are guilty of. The People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were wiſer than to be frighted out of their Birth-rights, by <hi>Rehoboams</hi> great words. And Oh that my Countrymen would underſtand their Liberty and Duty in this caſe, and not idolize thoſe who are indeed their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. Be not ſo fooliſh as to court your Servants while they make you ſlaves, and put a yoke of iron on your neck. For Magiſtrates who are made and maintained by us, to protect us; to oppreſs, enſlave and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us, is the higheſt Treaſon and Rebellion, againſt God and us, as all wiſe men know. For our Servants who are ſworn to defend us, and ſeek our good, thus wickedly to tyrannize over us, is moſt ſuperlative Treaſon, and tranſcendent Rebellion.</p>
               <p>Oh what a ſlaviſh ſpirit is there upon <hi>England</hi> at this day! that we ſhould ſuffer our enemies to domineer over us, and give them ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive wages for keeping us in ſlavery. No wonder if this Land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>Chaos,</hi> when things are turned up-ſide down, Servants become our Maſters.</p>
               <p>This is the cauſe why Tyranny hath ſo much prevailed both in Church and State, the People are not careful to preſerve that Power God and Nature hath given them, but ſuffer Magiſtrates and Miniſters (which by the Word of God are their Servants) to encroach upon their Rights, till at laſt they come to be their Lords.</p>
               <p>This midwiv'd <hi>Lord Biſhops</hi> into the world. The Churches grew neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, and ſuffered the Miniſters to take their Power from them, and when once they had let it go, they could not recover it again. And is it not the very ſame in Politick affairs? when People are ſo void of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as to give their own Power into the Magiſtrate's hands, or let him encroach upon their Liberties, can they expect any other but that he will be their Lord, and they ſhall be his Vaſſals? But that I may cloſe up this Particular, underſtand; <hi>Parliaments are the Peoples ſervants,</hi> we ſend them up as our Truſtees, to make Laws for our good; if they make Laws for our hurt, to oppreſs and injure us, they are faithleſs
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95245:23"/>
and treacherous ſervants, and ought to be dealt with accordingly. The King, Judges, Juſtices, Mayors, Conſtables, and all other Magiſtrates or Officers, are our ſervants, to protect us and ſecure us from Violence and Oppreſſion; if they break their Truſt and oppreſs us, the Law of God and Nature allows us, to call our ſervants to account, puniſh them according to their deſerts, and turn them out of our ſervice.</p>

               <p>THe Duty of Magiſtrates falls next under conſideration, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Theam is ſo large, that I cannot have room in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe for all the particular Duties of Magiſtrates, either Supream or Subordinate, I ſhall only mention ſome general Duties, under which many particular are comprehended.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then, Magiſtrates ought to make it their great deſign, both in their undertaking and exerciſing their Authority, to anſwer the ends of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment, and to proſecute thoſe ends, in the whole <hi>ſeries</hi> of their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions. They ſhould conſider the greatneſs of the work they take in hand, the ſtrictneſs of the account they muſt one day give, and examine well their own hearts, whether they mean in <hi>undertaking,</hi> what God did in <hi>inſtituting</hi> Goverment? whether Gods ends be their ends? whether they take the charge upon them for the glory of God, and good of the People; or for baſe ends of worldly honour and greatneſs?</p>
               <p>Alas! how few Magiſtrates are there, whoſe hearts will not condemn them in this, if they ſhould but dare to put the queſtion to them?</p>
               <p>Where is the Governor to be found who doth not make his private intereſt his cheifeſt end? that doth not take more care to honour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his poſterity, than God? that doth not ſeek the Peoples <hi>goods</hi> more then their <hi>good?</hi> as if the People had been made for them, not they for the People.

                  </gap>, <hi>Publique Servants</hi> or <hi>Workmen;</hi> you are not to conſume your time and treaſures, in idleneſs, but painfulneſs. <hi>You give the Lion, the Unicorn, and Beaſts of prey for your Arms,</hi> as if your Office did allow you to prey upon the People as you do; it were far more ſutable to your relation to give the <hi>Labouring Ox,</hi> thereby to ſignifie that you know your place, and mean to diſcharge the truſt repoſed in you, by taking pains for the People. You are called Repairers of Breaches, which will not be done without diligence. Magiſtrates are by their Office Nurſing Fathers, then learn of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to carry the People in your boſome, as a nurſing father doth the ſucking child, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.12. and ſhew your readineſs to ſerve all particular perſons, as often as you can; that they may have occaſion to ſay, you are the ſervants of God to them for good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that which is reported of <hi>Titus Vespaſian,</hi> who is ſaid never to have ſent away any perſon ſad from his preſence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be ſure you keep within the circumference of your relation, you are Publique Servants, take heed you do not forget your ſelves and your relation, and pleaſe your ſelves with dreams of Lordly Power over the People, whoſe ſervants you are. Be provident of the Peoples Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, be humble in the Peoples preſence, be curteous and affable in your carriage, amiable in your countenance; labour to win the Peoples love, by kindneſs and reſpect. Like <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperour, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himſelf ſo to the People, as he would have an Emperour to have done to him, if he had been a private perſon. Remember the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ends of Laſcivious <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> Luxurious <hi>Vitellius,</hi> Prodigal <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liogabalus,</hi> Bloody <hi>Nero,</hi> and others, who kept not within the bounds of their relation. If you tranſgreſs the limits of your ſtation, and ſpend your time in wantonneſs, luxury, prodigality and tyranny; the People one time or other will remember their relation, though you forget yours. It hath been obſerved by Hiſtorians of the Inhabitants of this Iſle, that though they endure long, they will not endure alwayes. They
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95245:24"/>
will bear much before they call their ſervants to account, but at laſt they uſe to make all even. Remember that proverb of a wiſe King, <hi>Oppreſſion makes a wiſe man mad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Wrath of a King is like the roaring of a Lion,</hi> we grant it.</p>
               <p>But <hi>the Wrath of the People is like the Raging of the Sea,</hi> which will overwhelm a thouſand Lions in an inſtant.</p>
               <p>You ſeem at preſent to imitate <hi>Canutus,</hi> once King of this Iſland, who ſitting in his Royal Chair by the Sea ſide, challenged a Lordly Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over the Ocean; and forbid the waves to touch his Robes, threatning them, if they did preſume to diſobey his commands: but the ſturdy waves not valuing his Lordly threats, approached his perſon, wet him to the thighs and skirts, forced him to remove his Chair, and retreat, and made him know the Ocean was above him. Beware of dallying too long with the <hi>Britiſh Seas,</hi> and lording it over the multitude of Waters; if once a Spring-tide ariſe, and <hi>Tame</hi> and <hi>Humber</hi> overflow, they will acknowledge little homage to your Lordſhips, and perhaps ſhew leſs. They will make you to remove your Chairs, as <hi>Canutus</hi> did, and perhaps renounce your Titles alſo. They will wet your thighs, and cool your luſts, and waſh your filthy bloody skirts; <hi>thoſe Rivers know no Lords.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. A third duty of Magiſtrates, is, <hi>To obſerve the Law of God them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that ſo they may by their example induce the People to the ſame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hearken not to thoſe wicked Earwigs; thoſe open Enemies to God, the world, and moſt of all to your ſelves, who tell you that you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Law. They ſerve their own bellies, and know no other God. They are the greateſt Plague and Judgment of the Land: ſuch <hi>Lepers</hi> ſhould not be endured in the <hi>Engliſh Camp.</hi> Such filthy Lawyers and Prelates are the <hi>Foxes</hi> and <hi>Wolves</hi> who annoy this Commonwealth; it never will be well with us till they are taken. Varlets that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons, and will tranſgreſs for a piece of bread, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.21. What ſeared conſciences, and whoriſh foreheads, have thoſe men, that dare to ſay <hi>that the King is above the Law?</hi> when as the Lord hath given a ſtrict and particular charge to the King, to have a copy of it by him, and reade therein all the dayes of his life, that he may learn to fear God and keep all his Statutes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.18, 19. If you think you have ſuch immunity above other men, put your finger in the flames, and try what priviledge you ſhall have more than others. O know that if you break the Law of God, the ſame place is provided for you, that is for others, Iſa. 30.33. <hi>Tophet is prepared of old, yea for the King it is prepared.</hi> Your Flatterers tell you, you may do what you pleaſe, <hi>for you are gods; but</hi> if you break the Law of God, <hi>you ſhall dy like men, and fall like one of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:95245:24"/>
Princes, Pſal.</hi> 82.6, 7. <hi>He ſhall cut off the ſpirit of Princes; He is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to the Kings of the Earth,</hi> Pſal. 76.12.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Magiſtrates are to execute Judgment and Juſtice in the Land, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.9. <hi>Becauſe the Lord loved Iſrael for ever, therefore made he thee King, to do Judgment and Juſtice.</hi> Not to do what he liſt, as the Court-Paraſits pretend, <hi>that the King can do no evil.</hi> Which they gather from that place, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.9 to 19. where the Lord bids <hi>Samuel</hi> tell the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the manner of the King, what he would do; how he would enſlave them, and oppreſs them, make them his Servants, take away their goods and poſſeſſions from them, and make them cry out by reaſon of their oppreſſion; now hence do thoſe wicked Advocates of Tyranny plead, that it is lawful for a King to do theſe things.</p>
               <p>O filthy and degenerate wretches, Apoſtates from the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, men given up to a <hi>reprobate mind,</hi> profeſſed enemies to mankind; how dare you thus to prevaricate with God and the world? to father your moſt damned Notions, hatched in the loweſt Hell, upon God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? as if the Judge of the whole Earth ſhould do as unrighteouſly as your ſelves. As if the Lord ſhould make a Law for Kings to tyrannize and oppreſs the People without controul; when as the Lord hath parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly enjoyned the King <hi>to keep all the words of his Law, and all his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, to do them,</hi> Deut. 17.19. the Lord foreſeeing that folly which the People would commit in asking a King, many hundred years before it came to paſs, made a Law, that if at any time the People ſhould ſay, <hi>I will ſet a King over me, like the Nations round about, Deut.</hi> 17.14. <hi>the King ſhould keep all his Statutes as well as the meaneſt perſon.</hi> And if you ask, why then doth he tell the People (when they asked a King) that this would be the manner of him? I anſwer, Not (ye Blaſphemers) as if the Lord allowed of ſuch Tyranny, but to deter the People from that folly which at preſent did poſſeſs them, in asking a King. For the Lord was highly diſpleaſed with them for it, as you may reade at large in the ſtory, He did give them their own deſire of a King, but in wrath, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.11. The King was made to do Judgment and Juſtice: if Tyranny and Oppreſſion be Judgment and Juſtice, it is lawful for the King to do that, otherwiſe not.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe <hi>Judges and Officers are appointed to judge the People with juſt Judgment,</hi> Deut. 16.18. and the Lord complains of the Magiſtrates, Pſal. 82. <hi>How long will ye judge unjuſtly, and accept the perſons of the wicked? Defend the poor and fatherleſs, do Juſtice to the afflicted and needy. Deliver the poor and needy, rid them out of the hand of the wicked.</hi> Here, here is the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95245:25"/>
Duty of Magiſtrates; but alas what ſhould one ſay unto them? they know not, neither will they underſtand, they walk on in darkneſs, all the foundations of the Earth are out of courſe. <hi>Ariſe, O God, and judge the Earth, for thou ſhalt inherit all Nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the Apoſtle inſtructs us what is the Duty of the Magiſtrate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.3, and 4. <hi>To give praiſe to them that do well, and to execute wrath upon them that do evil:</hi> And the ſame doth the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> affirm, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14. But how little are the Scriptures regarded now a-dayes? O what cauſe have we to take up that <hi>Lamentation,</hi> Iſa. 59.1, to 16? and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14, and 15. <hi>Judgement is turned away backward, and Juſtice ſtandeth a-far off; for Truth is fallen in the ſtreet, and Equity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter; yea Truth faileth, and he that departeth from evil maketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a prey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. A fifth general Duty of Magiſtrates, is to Protect and Defend the People. Therefore they are called <hi>Shepherds, Numb.</hi> 27.17. <hi>When the Lord told Moſes, that he ſhould go up to Mount Abarim, and ſee the Land, and be gathered to his People, he entreats the Lord to appoint another to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him, that the People might not be as Sheep without a Shepherd.</hi> So <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was choſen by God, <hi>to feed his People Iſrael,</hi> 2 Sam. 5.2. That is, to be their <hi>Shepherd</hi> and <hi>Leader,</hi> to watch over them for their ſafety; which he did according to the integrity of his heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.72. The Title of <hi>Shepherd</hi> is not appropriated to Miniſters, but belongs to Magiſtrates alſo; Now a good <hi>Shepherd</hi> layes down his Life to Protect and Defend the Sheep, <hi>John</hi> 10.11. Magiſtrates are called <hi>Shields, Pſal</hi> 47.9. and <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Her Rulers,</hi> the word in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is, her <hi>Shields;</hi> now the uſe of a <hi>Shield</hi> is to Defend.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Tola</hi> defended <hi>Iſrael, Judg.</hi> 10.9. and <hi>Gideon</hi> hazarded his life for the defence of his Country, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.17. not to make himſelf Lord over them, (for that he refuſed afterwards) He did not fight for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or Greatneſs, but for the Good of his Country. Thus <hi>Nehemiah</hi> adventured himſelf in perſon for the Peoples good, and would not flee to ſave his life, and leave the work unfiniſhed, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 6.11. though there were many and potent enemies round about. He was a Shepherd that loved the Flock, a true Shield to defend them from <hi>Tobiah, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballat,</hi> and the reſt of God's and their enemies: a Repairer of the Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches both in the People and the Wall.</p>
               <p>But alas, poor <hi>England!</hi> thy Shepherds are become Robbers, thy <hi>Princes within thee are roaring Lions,</hi> thy Judges are <hi>evening Wolves;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of defending the Flock, they devour it. Thy Shields are become Swords, which pierce thine own bowels. Thy Rulers inſtead of repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy Breaches, throw down thy Walls, and widen the Breaches among thy Inhabitants more and more.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:95245:25"/>But hear I pray you, O ye Heads of <hi>England,</hi> and Princes of theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; <hi>Is it not for you to know Judgement? who hate the good and love the evil, who pluck their skin from off them, and their fleſh from off their bones; who break the bones of the Lords People, and chop them in pieces for the pot, and boil them in the cauldron. The day is coming when you ſhall cry unto the Lord, but he will not hear you, he will even hide his face from you, as you have behaved your ſelves ill in your doings,</hi> Mich. 3.1, to 5. You are the Shepherds of this People, therefore thus ſaith the Lord, <hi>Wo be to the Shepherds</hi> of England, <hi>that do feed themſelves: ſhould you not feed the Flock? Ye eat the fat, ye cloath you with the wool; ye kill them that are fed, but ye feed not the Flock; with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them. Behold I am againſt the Shepherds, and I will require my flock at their hand, and cauſe them to ceaſe from feeding the flock, neither ſhall they feed themſelves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them,</hi> Ezek. 34.1, to 11.</p>
               <p>I ſhall inſiſt no longer on the Magiſtrates Duty at preſent, but come to his Due, which is contained in thoſe four Particulars mentioned in the Deſcription of Magiſtracy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Power,</hi>
               </p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Reaſon; Therefore.</p>
               <p>I ſhall begin in the next Chapter with the Power of the Magiſtrate.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Treating of the Power which the Magiſtrate is to be entruſted withall; ſhewing that he is to have ſo much Power as is adequate to the end of Government, relation of a publick Servant, and duties of his place; and that he hath no right to any Power contrary to that.</head>
               <p>I Am now come to the Magiſtrates due, or to treat of what is due to him from the People, which is principally comprehended in four particulars.</p>
               <p>I ſhall begin with the firſt, <hi>Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the word <hi>Power,</hi> I mean not <hi>Authority,</hi> but ſtrength ſufficient for
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95245:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the performance of that truſt, God and the People have repoſed in him; which by the <hi>Greeks</hi> is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and by the <hi>Latines, Vis,</hi> and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Authority,</hi> which is mentioned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. Becauſe <hi>Power</hi> is a means of carrying on, or executing Authority. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that word tranſlated <hi>Power,</hi> had been better rendred <hi>Authority.</hi> For the <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Strength</hi> which the Magiſtrate hath put into his hand is mentioned afterward in the 4th. <hi>Verſe,</hi> under the name of a <hi>Sword.</hi> And the Magiſtrate is ſaid to bear the <hi>Sword,</hi> becauſe it is delivered into his hand for the performance of his duty. But to be more plain in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, I ſhall ſhew you what <hi>Power</hi> is the Magiſtrates due, and what not.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then Poſitively, The Magiſtrate is to have ſo much <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Strength,</hi> as may conduce to the Glory of God, and Good of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; as is adequate to the End of Government. For otherwiſe the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice were a vain thing, if it were not inveſted with Power ſufficient to anſwer the End of its Inſtitution.</p>
               <p n="2">2. So much <hi>Power,</hi> as is adequate to the relation he is in. That is, a publick and painful <hi>Servant, Of</hi> God, and <hi>To</hi> the People. For to make a Servant, and give him too little Power for the relation you ſet him in, were to ſet up a man of ſtraw, or the Picture of a Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p n="3">3. So much <hi>Power,</hi> as may enable him to perform the duties of his place; to execute Juſtice, to Puniſh thoſe that do Evil, and Reward thoſe that do Well, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. And to defend the Nation in general, and every one in particular under his charge.</p>
               <p>Thus all, both Superiour and Subordinate Magiſtrates, muſt have <hi>Power</hi> ſufficient to perform the Duties of their ſeveral ſtations, and the Truſt which the People repoſe in them. This I think none will deny; but the queſtion will principally be, what <hi>Power</hi> the Magiſtrate ought not to have?</p>
               <p>For the greateſt inconveniences of Governmently in the exceſs of the Magiſtrates Power; I ſhall therefore ſpend moſt time about that.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then <hi>Negatively.</hi> The Magiſtrate is not to have any Power which is for the Peoples hurt; he was made for their good, and no reaſon he ſhould have any power for their hurt; power enough to make the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſlaves when ever he pleaſeth, to perſecute them for doing well, to take away their Eſtates, Liberties or Lives unjuſtly, this Power is not his due; becauſe it is contrary to the End for which he was made, <hi>The Peoples good, Rom.</hi> 13.4.</p>
               <p>It is a madneſs in any People, to ſuffer their Magiſtrates to take ſo much Power into their hands, as doth enable them when they pleaſe to hurt and oppreſs the People; it were not ſafe to truſt the beſt man alive, wi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h ſo much Power as to be able to injure us if he would: for it is a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:95245:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
common thing for Governours to play the Hypocrites; begin to govern well till they have cunningly eſtabliſhed themſelves, and got power enough into their hands to oppreſs the People, and then begin to Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize. Thus did <hi>Nero</hi> himſelf; his firſt five years he reigned well: And <hi>Tyberius</hi> did the ſame; but when they had eſtabliſhed themſelves in the Throne, and were poſſeſſed of as much Power as they thought ſufficient; murdered the <hi>Senators,</hi> oppreſſed the <hi>People,</hi> and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all manner of outrages.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Magiſtrate is not to have ſo much power as is unſutable to his Relation of the Peoples Servant; to have ſo much Power as to make himſelf their Lord: If a People will be ſo unwiſe as to give the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate Lordly Power, they may well be ſure he will uſe it to their thraldom; and do we not find it by woful experience this day? what are we better than ſlaves? when upon any pretence of the Court, they fetch Men out of their Houſes, where they are peaceably following their Callings; and though they have nothing to charge them withall, yet ſend them away to Priſons, where they keep them to the utter undoing of them and their Families; how many hundreds have been thus dealt withal, ſince theſe men have had this exorbitant Power in their hands? Is not this the very higheſt <hi>ſlavery?</hi> when Men dare not <hi>pray,</hi> or <hi>preach,</hi> or <hi>meet</hi> together to worſhip God, but they are haled to Dungeons. Oh <hi>England!</hi> this could not have been, if thou hadſt been ſo wiſe, as to have kept thy Power in thine own hands, and given no more to thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants than is ſufficient to perform thy ſervice.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Magiſtrates ſhould not have Power to pervert Juſtice, and deſtroy a Land; their duty is to execute Juſtice, and defend us; and are they not bereft of Reaſon, who would give them Power to deſtroy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe us? For a People to give the Power of the <hi>Militia</hi> into the hands of the King, is by interpretation a giving away of their <hi>Birthright,</hi> and expoſing their <hi>Lives, Liberties</hi> and <hi>Eſtates</hi> to his <hi>will:</hi> For if the King may command the <hi>Militia</hi> as he pleaſeth, what Tyranny is too hard for him? I deny not but the King is to bear the Sword for execution of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and defending the People; but to have the <hi>Militia</hi> wholly at his <hi>diſpoſal,</hi> is not that Sword due to him? for that is to have power to make the People ſlaves when he pleaſeth. And do not we find the ſad effects of this at preſent, when the Walls of our Cities are thrown down in a time of Peace (after an Act of <hi>Indemnity</hi>) which are the ſtrength and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of our Land, in caſe of a Forreign Invaſion?</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>We ſee this now, but it is too late, the Parliament have given the Power of the Militia to the King, and ſince all Authority is againſt us, what can we do?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:95245:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Parliament are our Servants as well as the King: we chuſe a King to govern us for our good, to preſerve our Lives, Liberties and Eſtates; we chuſe a Parliament, ſend them up to conſult our Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to aſſert our Liberties and Priviledges, to make Laws for the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God and our Good; theſe our Servants conſpire againſt their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and have wickedly robbed us of our Power, and ſhared it among themſelves; we are no more bound to ſubmit to their unjuſt and moſt prefidious Acts, than a Maſter is bound to ſtand ſtill, and let his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant give away his Goods, and undoe him.</p>
               <p>What Authority had a Parliament to give away our Birthrights, to enſlave the Corporations and Counties that ſent them up to aſſert their Freedoms, and to expoſe us to the luſts of wicked Oppreſſors? to give away the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Land to the King, to he diſpoſed of for our ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very? for who knowes not that it is put into the hands of <hi>bloody Papiſts,</hi> and <hi>Sons of Cruelty</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> in moſt parts of the Land? Did God give them this Authority? who dares ſo to blaſpheme? Did the People give them any ſuch Commiſſion? not in the leaſt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conclude they had no authority at all to do it. That they have no authority from the People, I make good thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is no People can be ſuppoſed to be ſo deſtitute of reaſon, and ſuch Enemies to themſelves, their Little-ones, and Poſterity, as to ſend up Truſtees to enſlave them, and undoe them, to give away their Birthrights and Priviledges, to expoſe their Lives, Liberties and Eſtates to Tyranny.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If any People ſhould be ſo fooliſh to ſend up Truſtees with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of this nature, yet it were unlawfully done; it were againſt the Law of God and Nature, and the Grant it ſelf null and void.</p>
               <p>It were a wicked and treacherous thing, for any man to give away the Power of preſerving his own, but eſpecially his Wiſe, his Children, and Poſterities Lives, Liberties and Eſtates; becauſe both the Law of God and Nature, oblige a man to preſerve all theſe; to give away the power of ſelf-defence from my ſelf, is moſt abominable treachery to my ſelf.</p>
               <p>To give it away from my Wife and Children, is moſt curſed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural treachery to them; and if a man ſhould give away this Power to another, yet the other hath no right to it by that grant; it is as if it had been never given. There are two infallible Maximes which make this good; <hi>Whatever a man gives, if it were not in his power to give it, is not obliging.</hi> But it is not in our power to give away ſelf and family-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; and therfore if a man ſhould do it, yet the grant were not obliging.</p>
               <p>Another Maxime as certain is that; <hi>Againſt the Law of God or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture nothing binds; But to give away the Power of Self and Family-defence,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95245:27"/>
to a King or Parliament, or both, or to any other Perſon or Perſons, is againſt the Law of God and Nature:</hi> And therefore if a People ſhould be ſo ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant as to do it, yet it doth not at all bind them. Suppoſe a Man ſhould give the King or Parliament an abſolute Power over himſelf, his Wife and Children, and they ſhould come to raviſh his Wife, or murder his Children before his face, were he bound to ſtand ſtill and ſuffer it? no ſuch thing; the Law of God and Nature binds him to reſcue his Wife and Children, if it be in his power, notwithſtanding that unlawful Act of his in giving them away before.</p>
               <p>The Parliament had no Authority from God to betray our Rights and Liberties; for God ordained Magiſtrates not for our <hi>hurt,</hi> but <hi>good, Rom.</hi> 13.4. They could have no authority from us, becauſe the Law of God and Nature obligeth us to defend them; and therefore there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed nothing but a pretence of Authority, which is as meer a cheat as any in the world; and we have the ſame right to all our Freedoms and Priviledges, that we had before they gave them from us; and as ſoon as we can, it is not only our Liberty, but Duty, for the ſake of our Wives, Children, and Poſterity, to reſume them again, and to turn theſe unfaithful Stewards out of our Service, with wages ſuitable to their merits.</p>
               <p>The Lawyers ſay there are ſome caſes, wherein, though the King make a Grant to a perſon by his Letters Patent, yet nothing paſſeth to the Patentee.</p>
               <p>I am ſure if Scripture, or Reaſon, or both, may give Judgement in our caſe, though the Parliament have given away our Birthrights <hi>perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly</hi> to the King, yet nothing paſſed of right to the King thereby.</p>
               <p>The Parliaments giving our Birthrights to the King, is juſt of as much force, as if the Convocation of <hi>Prelates,</hi> or Council of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> ſhould give our ſouls to the Devil; they have as much Power to do the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as the Parliament have to do the former; for both are againſt the Law of God and Nature: and the King hath juſt as much right to our Liberties, by the Parliaments Donation, as the Devil hath to the ſouls of thoſe, whom the <hi>Biſhops</hi> excommunicate and curſe.</p>
               <p>Let us not be ſuch Children in underſtanding, as to be frighted with a <hi>Pretence</hi> of Authority, to oppreſs us; for they have no other Authority, but what is derived from the Devil, and our <hi>perfidious</hi> Servants, the Parliament, who have ſold us for nought.</p>

               <p>I Come from the Power due to the Magiſtrate, to the Tribute; and I ſhall reſolve this as I did the former. 1. <hi>Poſitively.</hi> 2. <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Poſitively. Firſt,</hi> So much Tribute as is neceſſary for proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Ends of Government; <hi>viz.</hi> the Glory of God, and Good of the People, that is due to the Magiſtrate, and the People are in juſtice bound to render unto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> So much as is ſuitable to the Relation he is in. Servants muſt have ſufficient Wages to perform their Service; yea, it is their due in point of Equity.</p>
               <p>Magiſtrates are our Servants, and Wages competent to their Office is their due from us. Many Towns, Cities and Nations, have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed becauſe their Magiſtrates had not Wages enough to perform their Service. <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was made a prey to the <hi>Turk,</hi> by the Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Citizens, who would not furniſh the Emperor with Money ſufficient for the defence of the City.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> So much Tribute as is neceſſary for the ſeveral Duties of Magiſtrates, is due to them, to carry on Juſtice, and protect the Land; which varies according to the greatneſs of their truſt, and various E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergencies of publick affaires; which is the rule by which the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates Wages is to be proportioned.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Negatively.</hi> What-ever Tribute is indeed hurtful to the People, is not due to the Magiſtrate; becauſe it is contrary to the End for which Magiſtracy was ordained; he was made for their good, therefore they are not bound to maintain him to their hurt. If a Magiſtrate will have a Tax to maintain a ſtanding Army, which ſhall keep the People in ſlavery, they are not bound to pay it, becauſe it is for their hurt. If a Tax ſhould be levied for building <hi>Pauls,</hi> or any other <hi>Superſtitious buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> which is burdenſome to the People, they are not bound to pay it to their hurt.</p>
               <p>What ever Tribute the Magiſtrate demands not correſpondent to his Relation, we are not bound to pay him. If a Magiſtrate will multiply Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Gold, Horſes, Wives (or <hi>Whores</hi>) to himſelf, and in order thereunto lay Taxes upon the People, they are not bound to pay what he requires; becauſe the Lord hath forbid him to multiply <hi>Silver, Gold,</hi> or <hi>Horſes,</hi> (and by conſequence other things) to himſelf, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.16, 17. mark
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:95245:28"/>
the expreſſion; <hi>To himſelf:</hi> as if the Lord ſhould have ſaid, I allow the King <hi>Silver,</hi> and <hi>Gold,</hi> and <hi>Horſes</hi> enough to carry on the publick Affairs of Government, but he ſhall not ſatisfie his own Pride or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, or other luſts, out of your Purſes.</p>
               <p>We are bound to maintain the Magiſtrate as our Servant, not as our Lord; we are to pay him Tribute for the execution of Juſtice, not for the maintaining of Pride and Ambition: for the Command of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us to pay no more Tribute than is due, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.7. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>What Tribute is proportionable to the Relation of a Magiſtrate, I acknowledge to be his due, ſo long as he performs his duty to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but if he perſecute them for doing well, and oppreſs them, they are under no obligation from the Law of God or Nature to maintain him. The reaſon why the Word of God commands us to render Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the Magiſtrate, is becauſe, <hi>He is the Miniſter of God to us for good,</hi> Rom. 13.7. and 4th verſes compared: <hi>Render therefore to all their dues, Tribute to whom Tribute is due</hi> &amp;c. verſ. 7. Wherefore? <hi>Becauſe he is the Miniſter of God to thee for good,</hi> verſ. 4. And yet more plain, verſ. 6. <hi>For, for this cauſe pay you Tribute alſo, for they are God's publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, attending continually upon this very thing.</hi> What thing is that? That which he mentioned ver. 4. <hi>praiſing them that do well, puniſhing them that do ill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How manifeſt is it from this place? that the cauſe why we are to pay Tribute to the Magiſtrate, is for the good he doth us; <hi>Becauſe he is a Servant of God to us for Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what if they be Miniſters of the Devil to us for hurt? puniſhing us for doing well, attending continually upon our deſtruction, doing all they can to enſlave us, and oppreſs us, are we for this cauſe to pay them Tribute? then may we call darkneſs light, and light darkneſs; for theſe two cauſes are as contrary, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Belial, Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Rehoboam</hi> refuſed to eaſe the People of their burdens, they eaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves, <hi>by caſting off his Yoak,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.4. though they had endured many Oppreſſions in <hi>Solomons</hi> time, yet they would not endure it alwayes: And ſo may any People juſtly reject ſuch Governours, as lay intolerable <hi>Taxations</hi> and <hi>Exactions</hi> upon them: And why ſhould we be ſo ſlaviſh as to pay theſe men Wages, for chaſtiſing us with <hi>Scorpions?</hi> are we become Servants, are we homeborn-ſlaves? why are we thus ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led? <hi>The young Lyons roar on us, they yell &amp; make our Land waſte,</hi> Jer. 2.14.</p>
               <p>Oh! what a cry is there in the Land, of the poor and needy that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh for want of that which theſe wicked wretches ſpend upon their luſts? for by reaſon of their Tyranny and Oppreſſion, Trade is grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſtructed, by which the Poor ſhould be maintained, and Taxes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95245:29"/>
multiplyed; ſo that the greateſt number of thoſe who uſed to relieve the Poor, have ſcarcely now to provide for themſelves and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; and what they would give to the Poor, is forced from them by the Governours to maintain their <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Luxury,</hi> while the Poor pine away in neceſſity: And think you 'tis their due, to have the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Poor, to fulfill their luſts withal? Are we bound to pinch our ſelves, and ſtarve our Poor, to make fuel for the luſts of Rulers?</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But doth not Chriſt command us to render to</hi> Caeſar <hi>the things that are</hi> Caeſars? <hi>that is to pay Tribute to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol. Render to Caeſar the things that are Caeſars;</hi> that is, what is <hi>Caeſars</hi> due, render unto him. This is the ſame with what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.7. <hi>Render therefore to every one his due, Tribute to whom Tribute is due.</hi> Our Saviour ſayes no more than this, what is juſtly due to Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar, that render to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But Chriſt leaves the Queſtion unreſolved, whether Tribute were due to <hi>Caeſar</hi> or no, he ſeems rather to evade than to reſolve the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by an Anſwer that was dark and dubious, capable of divers inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations, which produced wonder, not ſatisfaction, in the Interrogators; for it is not ſaid they liked his anſwer, <hi>but they marvelled at it, and left him,</hi> &amp;c. ver. 22. concluding that they were too weak to enſnare him, by the wiſe anſwer he gave them at firſt word. If you ſay, doth not Chriſt infer that Tribute money was <hi>Caeſars</hi> due, becauſe it had <hi>Caeſars</hi> Image and Superſcription? I anſwer, <hi>No;</hi> forby that argument, all the money in the Land were <hi>Caeſars,</hi> for it had his Image, and no man were worth a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Chriſt rather ſeems to confound the Queriſts, than reſolve the Queſtion; but however, he enjoyns us to pay no more than his due.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But take notice of this, that he joyns God's <hi>due</hi> and <hi>Caeſars</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>Give unto Caeſar the things that are Caeſars, and unto God the things that are God</hi>'s; now the Poors due is God's, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.17. <hi>It is lent to God;</hi> and by the Law of God and Nature, the Poor have a right in out Eſtates, and ought to be maintained, and not forced to beg or ſteal, as many thouſands are at this day: And for us to give theſe men what they demand, to ſupport their luſts (if we can tell how to avoid it) is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the Poor of their right, and ſo rob God of his due, under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of giving <hi>Caeſar</hi> that which is not due to him.</p>
               <p>For whatever power <hi>Caeſar</hi> and his Officers have to rob the Poor, and ſpend their due in <hi>Laſciviouſneſs, Exceſs of Wine, Revellings, Banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> and other abominable <hi>Prophaneneſs,</hi> yet ſure I am they have no right to do it.</p>
               <p>But alas, may we not ſee that evil, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 4.1. <hi>I returned</hi> (ſayes <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon) and conſidered all the Oppreſſions that are done under the Sun, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95245:29"/>
behold the tears of ſuch as were oppreſſed, and they had no comforter; and on the ſide of their Oppreſſors was power, but they had no comforter. As a roaring Lion and a ranging Bear, ſo is a wicked Ruler over the poor People,</hi> Prov. 28.15.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But did not Chriſt himſelf pay tribute to wicked Rulers,</hi> Matth. 17.27. <hi>and are not we bound to be followers of Chriſt Jeſus?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Yes,</hi> in all juſt and reaſonable Taxes; but this ſeems to be an <hi>unjuſt</hi> and <hi>oppreſſive</hi> Tax, ſuch as Kings did not uſe to lay upon Natives of the Land, but Strangers, ſuch as they had conquered: now <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> being free-born perſons, and Children of the Nation, were in point of Equity free from this Tax; And ſo are we from thoſe unreaſonable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, which at preſent are laid upon us; we are not in conſcience bound to pay what they demand, for the ſatisfaction of their luſts, and continuation of our own ſlavery.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But doth not Chriſt's giving mnoey to the Tribute-gatherers, leſt he ſhould offend them, oblige us to give money to our Tribute-gatherers rather than give them offence?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Not at all, for the caſe differs exceedingly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> were but two perſons, and for them two to ſtand out againſt the Rulers oppreſſion, when all the Nation ſubmitted to it, was in vain. Chriſt took upon him the form of a ſervant, and was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to humble himſelf ſo, as to live in a low condition in the world, and did not come to determine Political Controverſies, by his Kingly Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but to be in a ſuffering condition; and unleſs he ſhould have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erced
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95245:30"/>
the Power of his Godhead, in vindication of his own and the Nations Liberties (which at that time was not his work) it had been in vain to contend with them. But it will not follow hence that the greateſt part of the Nation had refuſed to ſubmit to that unjuſt Tax and heavy burden, it had been unlawful for them ſo to do, or is for us at this time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> had a ſpecial work to do which the People of the Land had not; he was ſent to preach Glad-tydings to ſinners, to ſeek and ſave loſt ſouls, and to make known the Myſtery which had been hid from Ages; and if he ſhould have contended with the Rulers about Taxes, at ſuch a time when the Nation ſubmitted, it would have been the way to have hindered the work he came about; the Rulers would have been offended, and ſo have oppoſed his Preaching: but it will not follow hence that the generality of the Nation, who had no ſuch ſpecial work to do, might not have contended with their Rulers, for their juſt Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and Immunities, and caſt off thoſe heavy Burdens, which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours laid upon them (as they did in <hi>Rehoboam</hi>'s time) or that we may not contend with our Oppreſſors.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſt</hi> could avoid offending the Magiſtrates by ſuch a way as we cannot: he wrought a miracle, and got the money he gave to them out of the mouth of a Fiſh: we cannot give them what they demand, but we muſt take it out of the mouthes of our Wives and Children, and the Poor, who periſh for want of that we give to the Magiſtrate, to ſpend upon his luſts. If all the People of whom theſe men demand ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Tribute, could create money; or by a miracle get it, without depriving their Wives and Children, and the Poor of their due, there might be ſomething more to be ſaid for giving them money (though that would not make it our duty) but ſure we cannot give them what they ask, without impoveriſhing our Relations, and famiſhing the Poor of the Land; I conclude there is not a ſhadow of any Obligation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, to give them that which they require.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But would you make particular perſons Judges in their own caſe, whether the Tribute which Magiſtrates demand be juſt and reaſonable, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Publick affairs? by this means it were impoſſible for a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſubſiſt. For ſome out of Ignorance, others out of Covetouſneſs, or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, will be alwayes complaining and never contribute freely to the Publick charge, and ſo the Nation be undone.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Every free-born perſon may be conſidered under a twofold capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, Private, or Publick.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A Private capacity, as he is one ſingle perſon, disjoyned from the reſt of the Nation, and ſo private perſons are not Judges in their own
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:95245:30"/>
Caſe, what Tribute they are to pay the Magiſtrate, but ought to ſubmit to the Judgement of the whole Nation, unleſs they are certain that it be unjuſt; for if particular perſons are certain that the whole Nation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree an unrighteous Decree, they are not bound to ſubmit unto it. For inſtance, if a whole Nation ſhould denounce an unjuſt Judgement upon any one, to confiſcate his Eſtate, or take away his Life, for that which he had not committed, or for doing that which God had commanded him to do; he were not bound to ſubmit to this unjuſt Judgement, but might lawfully fly, and preſerve his Life, and carry away his Eſtate alſo if he could. So likewiſe, in matters of Tribute, if a Nation ſhould by common ſuffrage, decree an unrighteous War, to invade their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours cauſeleſly; a Superſtitious or Idolatrous Temple to be erected, a Heatheniſh or Antichriſtian Feaſt to be celebrated at Publick Charges, and appoint a Tax for defraying the coſt; in theſe or ſuch like unlawful Statutes, a private perſon may refuſe to ſubmit to the whole, or to bear any part in it; Becauſe their Judgement is contrary to the Law of God.</p>
               <p>But now if a Nation ordain a Tax which is not contrary to the Law of God, in this caſe a private Perſon is not to be his own Judge, but to ſubmit to the Judgement of the whole. As if a Nation by Publick conſent, ordain a Tax to be raiſed for maintaining a Navy, to defend them by Sea, an Army by Land, to build Garriſons for common Security, or a hundred other lawful things that might be mentioned in ſuch caſes, a private perſon is not to be his own Judge, what he ought to pay the Magiſtrate, but to ſubmit to the Judgement of the whole, becauſe there may be need of that which he doth not apprehend.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſuppoſe it were ſo, that in no caſe, a private perſon might be his own Judge againſt the whole; yet conſider a man in his publick capacity, as he is conjoyned with the whole, and ſo he is a Judge in his own caſe. For all particular perſons make up the whole, and in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect are Judges over the Magiſtrates; whom they made for their good, and maintain as their Servants; judges what Power, and Wages, is fit for their Servants to have.</p>
               <p>Que. <hi>But how ſhall we diſtinguiſh between ſuch Tribute as is due, and ſuch as is not due? for we had need be certain that it is not due if we refuſe to pay it.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. When Magiſtrates require Tribute for unlawful uſes. For inſtance, if they will have Taxes to maintain their Pride, Covetouſneſs, Laſciviouſneſs, Luxury, Prodigality, we are not bound to pay what they demand. I deny not but in prudence we may give it them, in caſe we cannot avoid it, without our own undoing; as a man would rather give his Purſe to a Thief, than be killed: But in Conſcience we are free to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95245:31"/>
refuſe, if we can with our own ſafety. When it is evident to the World, that Magiſtrates uſe our money, not for our good but hurt, ſerve their own Luſts with our wages, we are not bound to maintain them.</p>
               <p>O how many Hundred Thouſands, nay Millions of money have theſe men ſqueezed out of poor <hi>England</hi> within this three years? which hath been all ſpent upon their Luxury and our Slavery.

A Whirl-pool that ſucks in what ever comes near it, and ſo great, that if God permit them to continue a few years more, they will ſuck in the whole Land. A bottomleſs Pit as deep as Hell it ſelf. And think you that it is your duty to maintain Play-houſes and Whore-houſes for the Courtiers, with that which ſhould buy your Children bread, or feed the hungry bellies, and cloath the naked backs of the Poor?</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the Great Ones lay the burden on the Mean, the Rich caſt the burden on the Poor, the Poor are not bound to bear the burden for the Rich.</p>
               <p>If a Parliament, conſiſting of Lords, Knights and Gentlemen, who have the greateſt part of the Revenues of the Land, will caſt the burden of the Taxes upon the poor Handy-crafts-men and Labourers, who get their Living by the ſweat of their brows, it is unjuſt and not at all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When the Tribute is more than the People are able to pay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impoveriſhing the Land, and impairing the Common-wealth, when, not a few covetous or envious perſons, but the generality of the Nation, groan under their burden, and complain 'tis more than they are able to bear, and the Governours lay on more load ſtill; in this caſe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours are Oppreſſors, and the People may remedy themſelves if they can.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But the People have entruſted the Parliament with this affair, and therefore what Tribute their Truſtees have ordained, they are bound to pay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> I ſay as before, in the caſe of Power, we give the Parliament Authority to raiſe ſuch Tribute as is ſufficient for our ſecurity, and the Service the King is to do us; but we give them no Power to impoveriſh or oppreſs us, to give away our Wives and Childrens bread, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a company of Proud, Lazy, Drunken, Debauched Courtiers, filthy idle Drones, who will not work; and therefore by the Law of God

That the People ſhould give away their Eſtates from their Wives and Children, and the Poors due alſo, to make Proviſion for the Luſts of their cruel Taskmaſters, who ſpoil them of all their Liberties, both as Men and Chriſtians, is more than a hundred Parliaments have Power to decree, and we are unwiſe to endure.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Treating of the Honour which is due to the Magiſtrate.</head>
               <p>IN the handling of this Particular, I ſhall obſerve the ſame Method I did in the former, and ſhew you,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> What honour is due to the Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> What is not.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then, we owe to ſuch Magiſtrates as are <hi>a Terroun to evil Works, and a Praiſe to them that do Well,</hi> the Honour of ſuch juſt and lawful Titles as the People beſtow on them; as King, Judge, Sheriff, Mayor, or the like; which is ſo clear both in the Old and New Teſtament, that it needs no proof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We owe to them the acknowledgement of the good ſervice they do us, and thankful acceptation thereof, although it be no more then their duty.</p>
               <p>Thus we read the People did uſe to acknowledge the good they had received, by <hi>Moſes, Joſhua, Gideon, David,</hi> and other good Magiſtrates, and mourned for them at their Death: and good reaſon, for the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Land is bound up in the Government thereof.</p>
               <p>Such Princes as Govern well, deſerve Titles of Honour: The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were wont to give the Titles of <hi>Pater Patriae</hi> to their good Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, as they did to <hi>Auguſtus, Antoninus, Pius,</hi> and others. And <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> who refuſed to be called the Peoples <hi>Lord</hi> (as I mentioned before) yet did with the higheſt ſatisfaction, and thankfulneſs, embrace that Title of the <hi>Father of his Country.</hi> The Title of <hi>Lord of the Country,</hi> is far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour in the Judgement of all wiſe men, to that of <hi>Father of the Country.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea good Magiſtrates deſerve to be honourably mentioned after death, and had in bleſſed Memory by Poſterity; as <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, that young <hi>Joſiah,</hi> is, and will be to the Worlds end.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We owe them Honour in our geſtures, and behaviour, as we read
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95245:32"/>
the Lords People were wont to do, bowing the Head and the Body, in token of that honour which was due to them. Thus did <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1.23. Thus did <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.8. <hi>Araunah,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.21. And I judge it very lawful and requiſite to ſhew bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily reſpect to good Magiſtrates; although I cannot think it lawful for a Magiſtrate to puniſh any of the People, who are not ſatisfied of the lawfulneſs thereof, and upon that account do refuſe ſuch ceremonies, as putting off the hat, or the like.</p>
               <p>But in the next place, What honour is not due to the Magiſtrate?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Falſe or flattering Titles are not his due, though he be the beſt man upon Earth, <hi>Job</hi> 32.21. <hi>Let me not, I pray you, accept any mans perſon, neither let me give flattering Titles unto man; for I know not to give flattering Titles: in ſo doing my maker would ſoon take me away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To call a man <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> who is a <hi>Perſecutor</hi> of it. To call a profane Tyrant, Gracious; O what abominable flattery and falſity is this? To call wicked, perjured, profane Dukes, or bloody minded <hi>Popiſh</hi> Archbiſhops, your <hi>Grace;</hi> what is it leſs than Blaſphemy? It were fitter to call them your <hi>Vice,</hi> then your Grace.</p>
               <p>O you flattering Prieſts, Courtiers, Lawyers, and others, who thus accuſtome your mouthes to lyes, that you draw them in like your breath; conſider what your portion will be from the Lord, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. you are all to be <hi>caſt into the Lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone. The getting of treaſures by a lying tongue, is a vanity toſſed to and fro of them that ſeek death,</hi> Prov. 21.6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What ſhall be given unto thee? or what ſhall be done unto thee, O thou falſe tongue? ſharp arrows of the Mighty, with coals of Juniper,</hi> Pſal. 120.3, <hi>and</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>If you do not ſpeedily repent, know that you ſhall cry out one day for a drop of Water to cool this lying flattering tongue. But I know what your wicked hearts will anſwer, <hi>Let us alone till then and we care not;</hi> know therefore, that not onely God, but the People will abhor you; the Lord hath denounced that curſe againſt you, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.24. <hi>He that ſaith to the wicked thou art righteous, him ſhall the People curſe, Nations ſhall abhor him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The juſt and lawful Titles of Good Magiſtrates, are not due to wicked Magiſtrates; but they forfeit their right thereto, by their Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and Oppreſſion, or other miſgovernment. And therefore we find the Prophets, Chriſt, and Apoſtles, giving to wicked Magiſtrates Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of ignominy and diſgrace, ſuitable to their merits.</p>

                  <hi>Elijah</hi> tells wicked <hi>Ahab</hi> to his face, <hi>Thou art he that troubleth Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> 1 King. 18.18.</p>

                  <hi>Iſaiah</hi> calls the Rulers of his time, <hi>Rulers of Sodom,</hi> Iſa. 1.10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ezekiel</hi> calls the King of Iſrael, <hi>Prophane wicked Prince,</hi> Ezek. 21.25.</p>
               <p>Chriſt calls <hi>Herod, Fox,</hi> and bids them go and tell him <hi>ſo, Luke</hi> 13.32.</p>

                  <hi>Paul</hi> calls the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor, <hi>A Lyon,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.17. Yea, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and many thouſands of Chriſtians together (for ſo the company of Believers was, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41.) with one accord in their Prayers, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> by name, ſpread their wickedneſs before God, and deſire the Lord, <hi>To behold their Threats,</hi> Acts 4.27.</p>
               <p>It was no wonder the holy Prophets were ſo perſecuted by wicked Rulers, ſince they were ſuch faithful plain-dealing men, that knew not how to give flattering Titles unto them; but called them <hi>Rulers of Sodom, Troublers of Iſrael, Sons of Murderers,</hi> and <hi>Prophane wicked Perſons.</hi> No wonder the Governours looked upon Chriſt and his Apoſtles with an <hi>Evil eye,</hi> and puniſhed them as <hi>Seditious men;</hi> ſince they called them <hi>Foxes, Lyons,</hi> and gave them ſuch reproachful Titles, as they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. They hated plain-dealing and reproof, as all Tyrants do, and would be ſure to ſuppreſs that ſpirit (if they could) which dared preſume to reprehend their wickedneſs; and yet theſe holy Men were not afraid to give them Titles of diſhonour, anſwerable to their merits.</p>
               <p>Oh you wicked flatterers! that daub with untempered morter, and flatter great Men for advantage, ſee here what the holy Prophets and Apoſtles did, and take ſhame to your ſelves for your filthineſs. <hi>Wo to him that calleth good evil, and evil good, that putteth Darkneſs for Light, and Light for Darkneſs,</hi> Iſa. 5.20. <hi>Who juſtifie the wicked for reward, and take away the Righteouſneſs of the Righteous from him. Your root ſhall be rottenneſs, and your bloſſom duſt.</hi> The Lord is no reſpecter of Perſons, and hath forbid us to be ſo. If Kings or great Men be wicked, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be called as they are. Nay, take notice of this, that when the Chriſtians in their aſſembly, lift up their voice with one accord to God, and boldly prayed to the Lord, <hi>To behold the Threats of Herod and Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pilate,</hi> whom they mentioned by Name, relating their wickedneſs; the Lord ſhewed how exceedingly he was pleaſed therewith, in that, as ſoon as the prayer was ended, the place was ſhaken, <hi>and they were all filled with the holy Spirit, and great Grace was upon th<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> all.</hi> Perhaps if there were more boldneſs in the Aſſemblies of the Saints at this day, in bearing a faithful Teſtimony for God againſt theſe wicked Rulers, there would be a greater Preſence of the Spirit of God among them, and greater meaſures of Grace upon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:95245:33"/>And in like manner have the faithful Servants of the Lord in all Ages, born their Teſtimony againſt the wickedneſs of their Rulers.</p>
               <p>The Title which <hi>John Knox,</hi> that famous Servant of Jeſus Chriſt, and eminent Inſtrument of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Reformation, frequently gave to the Tyrannous <hi>Queen,</hi> who ruled the Land, was, <hi>Bondſlave of Satan;</hi> and he conſtantly prayed in publick, in words to this purpoſe, <hi>That God would deliver her from the Power of Satan, to whom ſhe was now a bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John Hus,</hi> that glorious Martyr of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> was not afraid to affirm to the Emperors face, <hi>That wicked Kings were not worthily Kings before God, Acts</hi> and <hi>Mon.</hi> Vol. 1. Pag. 807. And pag. 813. he ſayes, <hi>That Subjects and common People ought openly and publickly to detect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Vices of their Rulers, having Power given them of Chriſt, and Example of Paul ſo to do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Burgen,</hi> in his <hi>Oration</hi> which he made in the Counſel of <hi>Baſil,</hi> layes down this aſſertion; <hi>It is abſurd for a King to be of more Authority than his Kingdom: and he that ruleth not for the Good of his Subjects, is not to be counted a King, but a Tyrant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> in the Letter which he ſent to <hi>Lucius,</hi> King of this Iſland, about 170. years after the Death of Chriſt, affirms the ſame in theſe words; <hi>A King hath his Name of Ruling, not of having a Kingdom; and ſo long ſhall you be a King indeed, while you rule well; which if you do not, the Name of a King ſhall not remain with you, but you ſhall loſe it, Acts</hi> and <hi>Mon.</hi> Vol. 1. Pag. 139. Which <hi>Eleutherius</hi> is in high eſteem by Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorians, for the Eminency of his Wiſdom and Piety both; as indeed that very Epiſtle doth ſufficiently evidence, he deſerves to be.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee ſeveral eminent Lights in the Church of God, concur in the ſame <hi>Perſwaſion, That wicked Magiſtrates have no right to the Titles of ſuch Magiſtrates as rule well.</hi> Nay, the Antient Laws of this Nation give full teſtimony to this Truth: For in the Chapter of the Laws of King <hi>Edward</hi> (commonly called the <hi>Confeſſor</hi>) (by whom moſt of the good Laws we enjoy were made) treating of the duty of the King, the Law ſaith thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The King, becauſe he is the Vicegerent of the higheſt King, is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for this purpoſe, to reverence and rule the Kingdom, the Lords People, and holy Church, and to defend them from injurious perſons; to pluck away evil-doers utterly, to ſcatter and deſtroy them; which if he doth not perform, the Name of a King ſhall not agree to him, but he looſeth the title of a King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well then, let no man be ſo fooliſh and perverſe, as to charge this aſſertion with novelty or ſingularity; for you ſee what abundant Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95245:33"/>
there is, both from Scripture and Reaſon, <hi>That a wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous King, forfeits his right to the Title of a King.</hi> And though the <hi>perfidious Parliament</hi> (or rather <hi>mock Parliament</hi>) have lately betrayed their own Truſt, and our Liberties, making it Treaſon for us to mention the cruel Tyranny and Oppreſſion we groan under; yet by the antient Laws of <hi>England,</hi> this man that rules at preſent, is no rightful <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> but by oppreſſing the Nation, and perſecuting the Lords Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, hath loſt the Title of a King; and that the Name of a King doth not agree to him; but <hi>Tyrant</hi> is the Name due to him.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But doth not Elihu ſay,</hi> Job 34.18. <hi>Is it fit to ſay to a King thou art wicked, and to Princes, ye are ungodly?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> That is to a King in Truth, not in ſhew; not one that is a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant under the Name of a King. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> properly ſignifies <hi>Conſul,</hi> a wiſe and diſcreet Governour, who is a true King. Tyrants are not here meant. A King is one thing, and a Tyrant another.</p>
               <p>So the word tranſlated Princes, is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>liberal,</hi> or, <hi>ingenuous perſons:</hi> To call wiſe or ingenuous Governours <hi>wicked,</hi> were a ſlander: but doth it follow hence, that we may not call <hi>irrationel, covetous, diſ-ingenuous oppreſſing,</hi> Rulers, <hi>Wicked?</hi> the ſcope of the place plainly intimates this to be the meaning of the words; for the verſe foregoing, he ſayes, <hi>Wilt thou condemn him that is Moſt Juſt?</hi> meaning God; and then argues, <hi>A minore ad majus,</hi> from the leſſer to the greater. If it be unlawful to ſay to a wiſe or liberal Governour, <hi>thou art wicked:</hi> How much more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful is it to condemn <hi>God,</hi> who is the <hi>Moſt Juſt, Wiſe, and Liberal?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by the verſe following, it is evident, that he doth not intend to aſſert the Priviledge of Princes or great men above others; for he tells us, that God accepts not the perſons of Princes or Rich men, more than the Poor: and it is obſervable, that when he ſpeaks of ſuch Princes, whoſe Perſons are not accepted by God, he doth not uſe that expreſſion which is tranſlated <hi>Princes,</hi> ver. 18. and hath a virtuous ſignification, but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a word which hath no virtuous ſignification, but ſignifies barely <hi>Princes</hi> or <hi>great Men;</hi> and he tells us, <hi>That God regards no man for his greatneſs:</hi> and if this place ſhould be underſtood (as the <hi>Royaliſts</hi> would have it) to forbid us to ſpeak diſgracefully of wicked Rulers; then the holy Prophets and Apoſtles are to be blamed, for they did ſo, as you have ſeen before; but that is the true interpretation of the place which I have given; the other is only a gloſs which the Prelates give to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port Tyrants, under the ſhadow of whoſe wings they ſhelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But is it not ſaid who may ſay to a King, what doſt thou?</hi> Eccleſ. 8.4.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:95245:34"/>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> This argues the danger of oppoſing a King, not the unlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. In the word of a King is Power; he hath ſo much Power at his command, that no private perſon under his Government, is able to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him without his own ruine.</p>
               <p>But the meaning of the place is this; The King, for the execution of Juſtice, and puniſhing Evil-doers, hath ſo much power both from God and the People, that none may oppoſe him in the execution of Juſtice; and that this is the meaning of the wiſe Man, appears by the verſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going: <hi>Stand not before him in an evil thing,</hi> ſayes he; and then gives this as a reaſon; <hi>for he doth whatſoever he pleaſeth, and who may ſay to him, what doſt thou;</hi> that is, in puniſhing ſuch as will ſtand before him in an evil thing. But it is clear enough that the faithful Servants of God in Scripture, have ſaid more to wicked Kings, than, <hi>what doſt thou? Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> ſaid to <hi>Saul, Thou haſt done fooliſhly,</hi> 1 Sam. 13.13. <hi>Elijah</hi> to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab, Thou art he that troubleth Iſrael;</hi> yea, the People of God were bound to reſtrain and puniſh wicked Kings; and frequently did ſo, as I ſhall ſhew hereafter.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Doth not Paul confeſs his Error in ſpeaking reproachfully of the High Prieſt, though a wicked Ruler; and thereby teach us, That it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to ſpeak reproachfully of wicked Rulers?</hi> Acts 23.4, 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> No ſuch thing; the words do rather prove the direct contrary; for it is clear that <hi>Paul</hi> calls a <hi>wicked Ruler, Whited-wall;</hi> gives him a diſgraceful Title.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Paul</hi> knew him to be a Ruler when he called him ſo; for ſayes he, <hi>Sitteſt thou to judge me after the Law, and commandeſt me to be ſmitten con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Law?</hi> verſ. 3. he knew him to be Judge, and yet calls him <hi>Whited-wall;</hi> and without doubt he knew him to be the man they called <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> by the High Prieſts Robes, and the Place where he ſate; for <hi>Paul</hi> full-well underſtood the Cuſtomes of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Whereas it is alledged, That <hi>Paul</hi> corrects himſelf, or recants afterwards; there is no ground for it; <hi>I wiſt not,</hi> ſayes <hi>Paul, that he was High Priest;</hi> that is, truly and really ſo; as indeed he could not be, becauſe the <hi>High-Priesthood,</hi> was abrogated by the Death of Chriſt, who was the true <hi>High Priest.</hi> And beſides he was a Tyrant, and cauſed him to be ſmitten contrary to the Law; and therefore no lawful Ruler; and the Apoſtle anſwers not only the Objection which they made againſt him, for reviling the High Prieſt, by ſaying he did not know him to be High Prieſt, or own him for High Prieſt; but prevents another Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they might more plauſibly make, from <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.28. <hi>Thou ſhalt not revile the gods, or blaſpheme the Ruler of thy People.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid; I know you will ſay I have broken that Law, by

ſpeaking evil of a Ruler, but you are miſtaken; the Law doth not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid us to ſpeak evil of Tyrants, or Oppreſſors, but of lawful Rulers, who govern in Righteouſneſs. I do not own him for High Prieſt, or a lawful Ruler (though I know he ſits as Judge) that will thus wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pervert Juſtice. If he had been a good and lawful Ruler, I would not have ſpoken ſo reproachfully of him, as to have called him <hi>Whited-wall,</hi> but have honoured him, but this man, under the Title of <hi>High Priest</hi> and <hi>Judge,</hi> is a <hi>real Tyrant<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4. And that place which <hi>Paul</hi> cites out of the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.28. by the Title given to the Magiſtrate, ſhews that it means only <hi>just</hi> and <hi>righteous</hi> Magiſtrates, which rule according to God's Law; <hi>Thou ſhalt not revile the gods.</hi> Why are they called <hi>gods,</hi> but becauſe they repreſent the Wiſdom, Juſtice, and Truth of God, and are in his ſtead to execute Juſtice according to his Word? This Chriſt gives for the reaſon why they were called gods, <hi>John</hi> 10.35. <hi>Becauſe the Word of God came to them;</hi> that is, his Word of Commiſſion, to execute the Word of his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: but if they do the quite contrary (as this <hi>Wicked Ruler</hi>) they repreſent the Devil, and not God; and as I hinted before, are more fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly termed <hi>Devils</hi> than <hi>gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. This Text which <hi>Paul</hi> mentions, doth not forbid any juſt and plain reprehenſion of wicked Rulers: To ſpeak the Truth to, or of them, to tell them of their <hi>Vices,</hi> relate their <hi>Abominations,</hi> or give them ſuch <hi>Titles</hi> as they deſerve. But to ſlander or reproach good Rulers undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly, which wicked men are very apt unto, if they puniſh them for their evil doing.

               <p>Object. <hi>But doth not Luke give Theophilus, the Title of Most Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,</hi> Luke 1.3. <hi>and Paul give Festus the Title of Most Noble,</hi> Acts 26.25. <hi>who was a wicked man.</hi>

A man may be Powerfull and yet not honourable; For Honour is due to Virtue not to Strength. And therefore I conclude that it may be more rationally interpreted Powerful than Noble, ſince the word properly ſignifies ſo.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But are we not commanded to honour the King,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.17? <hi>Fear God, Honor the King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> We are no more commanded to honour the King, than all other men; for the whole <hi>verſe</hi> runs thus, <hi>Honour all men, love the Brotherhood, fear God, honour the King.</hi> And the very ſame word is uſed for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour we are commanded to give to all others, that is, for the honour we are to give the King. <hi>We muſt give honour to whom honour is due.</hi> Rom. 13.7. If the King be a real King, a lawful Ruler, who Governs well, we are to honour him, but if he be a Tyrant or Oppreſſor, as I ſhewed before, he forfeits his Title of King, and deſerves to be called as he is.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But if wicked Kings forfeit their Title by Tyranny, and evil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, why then are they called Kings ſtill as long as they poſſeſs the Crown?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solution,</hi> There is a twofold ſence in which the word King may be taken.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For a King Regnant, a King <hi>de facto,</hi> one that ſits on the Throne, wears the Crown, ſwayes the Scepter, bears the Sword, and actually Rules the Land.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A rightful King, or a King <hi>de jure,</hi> one that hath a right to do all this.</p>
               <p>Now wicked Kings are called Kings in the former ſence, but are not called ſo in the latter. They are Kings <hi>Regnant,</hi> but not Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Kings. They have not their name from any right they have to the Government, but becauſe they are poſſeſſed of it, and at the preſent are ſuffered by God and the People to fit on the Throne. Even as the Devil is called <hi>the God of this World,</hi> becauſe he doth actually bear rule in the hearts of the men of this world, not that he is a rightful Ruler over them, but becauſe he hath them at his command under his Power, and is generally received by the men of this World for their God and Ruler.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But why did Daniel uſe that Court phraſe to ſalute the King, which was a wicked Ruler,</hi> Dan. 6.21. <hi>O King, live for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Very likely <hi>Daniel</hi> prayed for his Eternal Life; For though the reſt of the Courtiers uſed it as a vain formal complement, yet in regard
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95245:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the words will bear a good ſence, it is likely that ſo Godly a man as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> meant in the beſt ſence, and ſo wiſhed his Salvation. But if <hi>Daniel</hi> ſhould have meant vainly as the reſt of the Courtiers did, it was his failing; as it was <hi>Joſephs</hi> to ſwear by the Life of <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> and is not imitable by us.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But doth not the Apoſtle Peter make it one of the Characters of thoſe who are unjuſt, and are reſerved to the day of Judgement, to be puniſhed, that they deſpiſe Government and ſpeak evil of Dignities?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> It is one thing to deſpiſe Government, another thing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe Tyranny. Government is as I have ſhewed before, from God; Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny from the Devil. We may not deſpiſe lawful Rulers, ſuch as exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Juſtice, and rule in the Fear of God; but we may deſpiſe thoſe Rulers who Oppreſs, Murder and Deſtroy the People.</p>
               <p>Again, though we may not ſpeak reproachfully of Dignity, or Glory, (as the word ſignifies) yet we may of Tyranny. For there is no digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Tyranny, it is the higheſt indignity in the World. We may not ſpeak reproachfully of Government, becauſe it is Gods Ordinance for our good, and there's much Dignity or Glory in Gods <hi>Inſtitution.</hi> But we may of Tyranny, becauſe it is an Invention of the Devil and wicked Men, for our hurt, and is a vile abominable thing, hateful to God and Man.</p>
               <p>But that I may cloſe this particular of the Honour due to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A wicked Magiſtrate hath no right to that Honour or Reverence, which is due to a good Magiſtrate, in the external geſtures of the Body. A Proud, Tyrannous, Lordly Magiſtrate, who forgets his Relation of being a Servant to the People, and hath his heart lifted up above his brethren, contrary to the Law of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.20. forfeits his right to that external Reverence, of bowing the Head or Body, which is due to a humble, painful, and faithful Magiſtrate. Therefore it was, that when <hi>Rehoboam</hi> domineered over the People in that proud inſolent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, they refuſed to honour him any longer, but gave him a very dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutive title; <hi>What portion have we in the Son of Jeſſe,</hi> 1 King. 12.16. and bid him look to his own Houſe. And well he deſerved to be ſo ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for doth not the Word of God ſay? <hi>Bleſſed is the man that reſpecteth not the proud, nor ſuch as turn aſide to lies,</hi> Pſal. 40.4.</p>
               <p>Therefore it was that ſingle hearted <hi>Mordecai</hi> would not bow nor do any reverence to wicked <hi>Human,</hi> though he were the greateſt Prince of the Empire, <hi>Eſter</hi> 3.2. And the King had commanded that all men
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95245:36"/>
ſhould bow and do him reverence; <hi>Mordecai</hi> knew he deſerved no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour becauſe he was a proud and unworthy perſon.</p>
               <p>But how far forth in a caſe of neceſſity (when we cannot avoid it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out endangering our Lives or Liberties) we may diſpenſe with this Ceremony of bowing the Head, or uncovering it, before a wicked Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, is another queſtion.</p>
               <p>For though we owe him no ſuch honour, yet we may owe to our ſelves ſuch a geſture, for preſervation of our Lives or Liberties. For if <hi>David</hi> might eat of the <hi>Shew-bread,</hi> for the ſatisfaction of hunger, which was not otherwiſe lawful, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.4. <hi>I</hi> conceive we may as lawfully bow the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or uncover the Head to a Ruler, who doth not deſerve it from us, rather than deſtroy our ſelves; as one would to a Thief on the high way rather than be killed or wounded.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Poſitively, To follow the common received Diſtinction of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience Active and Paſſive, we owe both to a lawful Magiſtrate, in all his juſt and lawful Commands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> If the Magiſtrate command us to do any thing which he hath Authority from God and the People to command, we are bound to obey him actively: If he command us to perform our part in th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If the Magiſtrate command us to depart from any vitious Aſſembly, to reſtore any man his due, to obſerve juſt Weights and Meaſures in our commerce, to keep the Peace, to render him ſuch Tribute as is due, or
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95245:36"/>
to obey any other juſt and righteous law it is our duty to yeeld a ready and chearful obedience thereto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We are bound to obey him Paſſively, if we have by our Tranſgreſſions fallen under the condemnation of any juſt and righteous Law. If a Man or Woman have committed Theft, Murder, Adultery, Perjury, Extortion, or any other wickedneſs puniſhable by the Law, and be brought before the Magiſtrate, who is by God and the People en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the Sword, for the puniſhment thereof; it is their duty patiently to ſubmit to ſuch puniſhment, as they have deſerved.</p>
               <p>Whether one may not lawfully fly and with-draw himſelf peaceably, if he be guilty of Puniſhment, eſpecially in a caſe of Life and Death, is a Queſtion I have not time to diſcourſe here.</p>
               <p>But to make any violent reſiſtance, or forcibly to oppoſe the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, in executing juſt puniſhment upon us for our evil Deeds, is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unlawful.</p>
               <p>Thus far I grant the Scriptures command us to obey Magiſtrates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, in performing all their juſt and lawful commands; paſſively, in ſubmitting to ſuch due puniſhment as they inflict upon us for doing evil.</p>
               <p>And this is the ſubmiſſion <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13, 14. <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your ſelves to every Ordinance of man for the Lords ſake, whether it be to the King as Supream, or unto Governours, as unto them that are ſent by him, for the puniſhment of evil doers, and praiſe of them that do well.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mark well the <hi>Submiſſion</hi> the Apoſtle requires, we are to ſubmit to thoſe Governours, that come for the <hi>Puniſhment of evil doers, and Praiſe of them that do well.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame doth the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> teach, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4.5. <hi>For he is the miniſter</hi> (or ſervant) <hi>of God to thee for good; <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ut if thou do evil, be afraid, for hee bareth not the Sword in vain, for he is the Servan<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of God, a Revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil. Wherefore ye muſt needs be ſubject, not onely for wrath, but for Conſcience ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not left to our liberty, whether we will be ſubject or no, to thoſe Magiſtrates that <hi>puniſh evill doers, and praiſe them that do well,</hi> but in point of Conſcience we are bound to be ſubject unto them.</p>
               <p>Indeed, the very Light of Nature teacheth ſubjection to ſuch Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, as puniſh Vice and praiſe Virtue: and to reſiſt the Magiſtrate in the due puniſhing of Vice, or praiſe of Virtue, is not only a Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law of God, written in the Scriptures of Truth, but of the Law of Nature written in the hearts of all mankind. But the greateſt Queſtion will be, what obedience we do not owe to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate; for I need not ſpend my time and pains to confirm that which is ſo clear,</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:95245:37"/>2. <hi>Negatively,</hi> I affirm as followeth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Obedience due to the Magiſtrate from the People, is no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile obedience, but a free, liberal and ingenuous Obedience: It is not the obedience of Servants to a Maſter, but of Free-men to their own Servant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore ye muſt needs be ſubject,</hi> Rom. 13.5. What means that <hi>wherefore?</hi> it relates to ver. 4. <hi>For he is a Servant of God TO thee.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid; Therefore ye muſt needs be ſubject, becauſe he is a ſervant of God <hi>To You</hi> for good. Magiſtrates ought to command the People not in a lordly, proud, magiſterial manner, as if the People were their Vaſſals, but in a humble, modeſt, miniſterial manner, as being Servants to God and them whom they do command; mixing Entreaties with Commands. Thus did <hi>Moſes</hi> treat the People, in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful manner, entreating them as well as commanding, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.26. Thus did <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> chap. 5.10, 11. Yea, the very wicked Kings themſelves had not ſo much forgotten their relation, but they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred to ſpeak reſpectively to the People, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.22. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20.7. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.7. But now every inferiour Officer commands us after a moſt inſolent and lordly manner, as if we were home-born ſlaves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The obedience due to the Magiſtrate is not excentrical to his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; if the Magiſtrate command the People to do a thing that is in it ſelf lawful, yet if it be extrinſecal to his Office, the People owe him no obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience therein; becauſe he hath no power to command us any thing beſides his Office. We owe the Magiſtrate obedience in every lawful Command, but not in every lawful thing. For it is unlawful for the Magiſtrate to command us many lawful things. It may be lawful for a man to take the Magiſtrate's daughter to wife, or a woman to take his ſon for her husband; but if he commands them to do ſo, they are not bound to obey him, becauſe he hath no power to give ſuch a Command. It may be lawful for any one to lend the Magiſtrate his money, or goods, without ſecurity; yet if the Magiſtrate command a man to do ſo, he is not bound to obey him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We owe the Magiſtrate no ſinful obedience. To obey him rather than God, is a moſt Atheiſtical practice. <hi>Daniel</hi> would not obey <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> his wicked Command, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Daniel</hi> prayed the more boldly and openly, becauſe the King had forbid him. <hi>Hananiah, Miſhuel,</hi> and <hi>Azariah</hi> would not fall down to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar's</hi> Image, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.16, to 19. The Apoſtles would not forbear preaching for the Command of the Rulers, but continued in their Work, notwithſtanding all their threats, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.19, 20. they told the High-Prieſt and Council, <hi>that they would preach:</hi> And when they were apprehended again for Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:95245:37"/>
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 5.27. They told the Rulers plainly, <hi>that they ought to obey God rather than them,</hi> and charged them with the murder of Chriſt to their faces.</p>
               <p>If Magiſtrates command us to perſecute the Lord's People, to oppreſs the Innocent, to hale the faithful Servants of God to Priſons, to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Guard while they ſpill innocent blood; to prevent any from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuing ſuch as they intend to murder, we are not to obey them but God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We owe the Magiſtrate no paſſive obedience or ſubjection, in caſe he injure or oppreſs us. If we have done that which is evil, we are bound to ſubmit our ſelves to the Magiſtrate, as the Servant of God and the People, to execute wrath upon us; but if he puniſh us for doing well, oppreſs the Innocent, and pervert Juſtice, we are not bound to ſubmit our ſelves to him, but may lawfully reſiſt him. Which I prove thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Law of God doth not command us to be ſubject to the Magiſtrate, or forbid us to reſiſt him, if he oppreſs us, and offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to us. Now <hi>ſin is a tranſgreſſion of the Law,</hi> 1 John 3.4. and <hi>where there is no Law, there is no tranſgreſſion,</hi> Rom. 4.15. But all the Prelates in <hi>England</hi> cannot produce any Law of God, which forbids us to defend our ſelves from the injury, or injuſtice, of the Magiſtrate, or to reſiſt him in our own defence:</p>
               <p>The great place they urge to prove the unlawfulneſs of reſiſtance, is that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. Let us therefore take a ſurvey of that place, and ſee if there be any injunction to obey an unjuſt or oppreſſing Magiſtrate, or any prohibition to reſiſt him.</p>
               <p>And truly we ſhall find juſt as much reaſon from that place for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and obedience to a wicked oppreſſing perſecuting Magiſtrate, as from 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.12, 13. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. for obedience and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to an ignorant, proud &amp; perſecuting Miniſter. The Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us <hi>to obey them that have the rule over us, and ſubmit ovr ſelves to them, becauſe they watch for our ſouls, that they may be able to render an account of them with joy in our ſalvation:</hi> Will it follow therefore, we muſt obey and ſubmit to ſuch Miniſters as would poiſon and deſtroy our ſouls, and lead us to Hell and Damnation? <hi>The Elders that rule well are worthy of double honour, eſpecially thoſe who labour in the Word and Doctrine:</hi> Will it follow therefore that we muſt give double honour to the Elders who rule wickedly, and labour not in the Word and Doctrine?</p>
               <p>The very ſame doth the Scripture aſſert concerning Magiſtracy. <hi>Paul</hi> commands us <hi>to be ſubject to the Magiſtrate,</hi> and tells us why: <hi>for he is the Servant of God to us for good,</hi> he is one that will <hi>praiſe us if we do well;</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:95245:38"/>
and he is <hi>not a terror to good works,</hi> but <hi>to evil:</hi> Will it follow therefore we <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſt be ſubject to a Magiſtrate, who is a <hi>terror to good works,</hi> and a <hi>praiſe to evil;</hi> that <hi>puniſheth good men,</hi> and <hi>praiſeth wicked men?</hi> What a ridiculous, irrational Argument is this? But to lay open the folly of this Inference a little more plainly and diſtinctly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Power the Apoſtle forbids us to reſiſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is, <hi>The Ordinance of God:</hi> but a Power to oppreſs, or do injuſtice, is none of God's Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but the Devils; therefore we may reſiſt that. God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained no Power to oppreſs or injure the People; and therefore in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting a Power that oppreſſeth us, we cannot reſiſt God's Ordinance. The holy Spirit repreſenting the tyrannous Kings of the fourth Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, by a beaſtly cruel Monſter, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.1, 2. tells us, that <hi>the Dragon,</hi> or Devil, <hi>gave them their Power.</hi> Lawful Power to execute Juſtice, and protect the People, is derived from God. Tyrannous Power, to do In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and oppreſs the People, is derived from the Devil. Now ſurely to reſiſt that Power which is derived from the Devil, is not to reſiſt God's Ordinance; nay, it is blaſphemy againſt God to ſay ſo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He that reſiſteth the Power <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, ſhall receive to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf damnation or judgment. Therefore it is clear he means not an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt or oppreſſing Power, but a juſt, rational and righteous Power. Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants and Oppreſſors have been often reſiſted by the Lord's People, as I ſhall ſhew anon out of Scripture. And the <hi>French, Bohemians, Scots,</hi> and moſt, if not all the Proteſtant Nations, have reſiſted the oppreſſing Power of their wicked Rulers. Thoſe confident and faithful Witneſſes of Chriſt, the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> have frequently oppoſed their unrighteous Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, by force of Arms, and now lately done the ſame; and think you they ſhall all receive damnation for reſiſting that Power, which is derived from the Devil? or for reſiſting Tyrants, which are not God's but the Devil's Vicegerents?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Power the Apoſtle forbids us to reſiſt, is a Power that if we do well, we ſhall have praiſe of the ſame, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.3. but an oppreſſing unrighteous Power, doth not praiſe us when we do well, therefore we may reſiſt that. An unjuſt Power will praiſe thoſe that do evil, and diſpraiſe thoſe that do well, as we ſee moſt evidently at preſent.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Magiſtrate <hi>Paul</hi> forbids us to reſiſt, is one who is a <hi>Miniſter</hi> or Servant <hi>of God to us for good:</hi> but an unrighteous, oppreſſing Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate is a Servant of the Devil to us for hurt, therefore we may reſiſt him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Rulers we are forbid to reſiſt, are ſuch as are not a terror to good works, but to <hi>evil, Rom.</hi> 13.3. But Tyrants and Oppreſſors are not a terror <hi>to evil works, but to good;</hi> therefore we may reſiſt them.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:95245:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>6. The cauſe why we are commanded to be ſubject to, and forbid to reſiſt a Righteous Magiſtrate, doth not agree to an Oppreſſor: for if you obſerve the reaſon which the Apoſtle urgeth all along that diſcourſe, for ſubjection to the Magiſtrate, cannot be applied to an Oppreſſor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that reſiſteth,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>ſhall receive to himſelf damnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One might anſwer, This is a very hard ſaying, that you ſhould threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten us ſo ſeverely, if we reſiſt: but ſayes the Apoſtle, Conſider well the reaſon, and you ſhall confeſs there's reaſon enough for it; For Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the Power? Do that which is good, and thou ſhalt have praiſe of the ſame: <hi>for he is the Miniſter of God to thee for good,</hi> ver. 3, 4. Indeed if I threatned you for reſiſting Tyrants or Oppreſſors, who are a terror to good works, and a praiſe to evil; who are enemies to you, and ſeek your hurt, you might ſay it were a hard ſaying; but ſince I forbid you to reſiſt only thoſe that praiſe you when you do well, and are Servants to God and you for your good, you have no reaſon to ſay I ſpeak harſhly; for it is a great wickedneſs to reſiſt righteous Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates.</p>
               <p>Again, when the Apoſtle bids us be afraid of the Magiſtrate, if we do evil; he gives us this reaſon for it: <hi>for he is the Miniſter,</hi> or Servant, <hi>of God, a Revenger, to execute Wrath upon him that doth evil,</hi> v. 4. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye muſt needs be ſubject, not only for Wrath, but for Conſcience ſake,</hi> ver. 5. But this can lay no obligation upon our Conſcience, to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto one who is a Servant of the Devil, to revenge him upon thoſe that do well.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe (ver. 6.) he tells us the cauſe why we are to pay Tribute to Magiſtrates. <hi>For, for this cauſe pay ye Tribute, becauſe they are God's Miniſters</hi> (or Publick Servants) <hi>attending continually upon this very thing.</hi> What thing is that? that which he had mentioned before: <hi>[They are God's Servants, continually attending upon your good, to praiſe thoſe that do well, to puniſh thoſe that do evil: and this is the cauſe why you are to pay them Tribute.]</hi> But there's no ſuch cauſe to acknowledge unrighteous Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, but one may plainly invert the words thus: For this cauſe pay them <hi>no Tribute,</hi> for they are the <hi>Devil's ſervants,</hi> continually attending upon this very thing, to injure and oppreſs you.</p>
               <p>So that I conlude there is no reaſon or cauſe why we ſhould be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Oppreſſors, and therefore no obligation.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But doth not the Apostle mean Nero, becauſe he ſayes, Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher Powers? now it is generally received, that Nero was the highest power when the Apostle wrote this Epiſtle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. There are very learned men who do affirm otherwiſe; that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:95245:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this Epiſtle was written in the dayes of <hi>Claudius Caeſar;</hi> but becauſe Hiſtories are ſo various, I ſhall not inſiſt on that.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Suppoſe it had been written in the Reign of <hi>Nero,</hi> either it was written in the firſt five years of his reign, while he ruled well, or after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when he turned Tyrant. If it were written in the firſt five years of his reign, and we ſhould allow that the Apoſtle means <hi>Nero,</hi> yet this doth no way contradict what I have aſſerted, <hi>That it is lawful to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt Tyrants or Oppreſſors.</hi> For while he ruled well, I ſhall grant, that it was unlawful to reſiſt him. But if it were written after the time that <hi>Nero</hi> turned Tyrant, which is that the advocates of Tyranny would have, I utterly deny that the Apoſtle means <hi>Nero,</hi> for theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe the Properties of this Power which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, do no more agree with <hi>Nero,</hi> after he turned Tyrant; then the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Light with Darkneſs. The Power <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, is a praiſe to them that do well, and a terrour to them that do evil: but <hi>Nero</hi> was then one of the greateſt terrours to them that did well, that ever was in the world; the greateſt <hi>Murderer</hi> of the <hi>Saints,</hi> that filled the ſtreets with the dead bodies of thoſe that did well. The Magiſtrate <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Is a Servant of God to the People for good. Nero</hi> was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt plague, one of them, that ever was both to the Church of God, and the whole world; one that murdered <hi>Senators, Citizens, Chriſtians, Kindred,</hi> all manner of perſons; filled the Rivers with Chriſtian-blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Magiſtrate <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, is one whom we are to <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> verſ. 7. but <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf ſpeaks reproachfully of <hi>Nero,</hi> and calls him <hi>Lyon,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.17. Nay, Thirdly;</p>
               <p>By this interpretation, the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> muſt be damned, becauſe they reſiſted <hi>Nero,</hi> and condemned him to a moſt ſhameful Death; which action of theirs was never diſapproved of, by any man that had not loſt his Wits or Conſcience, or both, as it is to be feared moſt of the Prelates have, before they undertake to plead for Tyranny.</p>
               <p>But I conceive it to be meant, neither of <hi>Nero</hi> (in the time while he reigned well, nor in the time of his Tyranny) or any other particular Governour, or Governours, but of Government in the general, as the Ordinance of God, and true Magiſtrates, who are conformable thereto; as indeed the whole Series of arguments, which the Apoſtle there uſes, doth evidence. The Apoſtle in that <hi>Chapter,</hi> gives us a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary of the Doctrine of Magiſtracy; the Lord knew that his Church would increaſe, and that the multitude of Believers would be more and more augmented, till the Second coming of Chriſt; and therefore he left rules of Magiſtracy, to direct Chriſtians how to behave themſelves in conformity to that Ordinance. The Apoſtle doth moſt perſpicuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:95245:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
lay down the Nature and End of Magiſtracy; the duties of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and People, Rulers and Ruled; with the grounds and reaſons thereof; Shewing Chriſtians what is the Magiſtrates Relation to God and them; and what is the benifit and advantage of this Ordinance; and perſwading them to live in ſubjection to thoſe, who govern accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Rules of Magiſtracy: but here is not a word of Tyranny, or ſubjection to Tyrants to be found.</p>
               <p>And whereas he bids us, <hi>Be ſubject to the Higher Powers,</hi> that alſo makes it plain that he meant not <hi>Nero,</hi> or any other particular perſon; for he puts it in the Plural Number, taking in all lawful Governours whatſoever, as well as the chief Magiſtrate: and it were better render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the <hi>Super-eminent Authorities;</hi> or, the <hi>Authorities</hi> that are over us; and ſo <hi>Judges, Mayors,</hi> and other ſubordinate Governours, are as fitly termed Authorities over us, as the Supream Magiſtrate; they are as much the Ordinance of God as he, <hi>Servants of God to us for good,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to puniſh Evil-doers, and a praiſe to them that do well; and the chief Magiſtrate is not the <hi>higheſt Power,</hi> for the Peoples power is above his; they make him, and maintain him, and can depoſe him if he deſerve it, as the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> did <hi>Nero;</hi> for <hi>Nero</hi> was not the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Power of <hi>Rome,</hi> but the <hi>Senates</hi> Power was above his, and for his Tyranny they condemned him to a moſt <hi>Shameful Death;</hi> to avoid which he executed himſelf.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But doth not the Apoſtle command us to be ſubject to the Powers that are? it ſeems by that, that whoſoever have the Power we muſt be ſubject to them, good or bad Governours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> No ſuch thing: For the word tranſlated Powers, in its proper and native ſignification, is, <hi>Authorities,</hi> or <hi>lawful Powers,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and the whole ſcope of the place ſhews plainly, the Apoſtle means no other Powers but <hi>juſt, rational,</hi> and <hi>good Governours,</hi> who are a <hi>terrour</hi> to <hi>evil works,</hi> and a <hi>praiſe</hi> to <hi>good.</hi> The Apoſtle doth not intend to aſſert Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, or teach us that the unrighteous Powers of the Earth, are the Ordinance of God; but he means the righteous Powers that are, ſuch as God hath ordained for the <hi>Good of mankind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But we receive ſome good from unrighteous and oppreſſing Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, and though they do not fully come up to the duties God requires of them, yet they defend us from Theeves and Murderers, and it is better then it would be if there were no Magiſtrates; for then we could not live, no man could have any aſſurance of any thing he calls his Own; and for that good we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from them, we are to be ſubject to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. This Objection I confeſs hath been traditionally handed from one to another, and been received by thoſe who ſee more with other
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95245:40"/>
men's eyes than their own. But whereas it is pretended that Tyrants do us ſome good in defending us from <hi>Theeves</hi> and <hi>Murderers;</hi> I cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that; it is but <hi>Gratis dictum,</hi> for they are ſo far from defending us from them, that they make <hi>Theeves</hi> and <hi>Murderers,</hi> by deſtroying Trade, and oppreſſing the People with unreaſonable Taxes, and Exactions; and being patterns to others in Profuſeneſs and Prophaneſs, they daily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the number of <hi>Theeves</hi> and <hi>Murderers</hi> in the Land; yea, <hi>wicked Governours,</hi> are the principal Cauſe of <hi>Theeves</hi> and <hi>Murderers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. And no wonder they ſhould make Theeves and Murderers; for they are Captains and Leaders of that Troop; <hi>Theeves</hi> and <hi>Murderers</hi> learn of them. What are thoſe cruel Exactions that they lay upon us to maintain their Luſts, but publick Thefts? and doth not the Blood of the poor Innocents cry out againſt them, <hi>as Murderers?</hi> yea ſurely, the Voice of the Blood of thoſe hundreds theſe men have murdered by fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Priſons, for obeying God's Commands, cryes aloud againſt them. Tyrants are the greateſt <hi>Theeves</hi> and <hi>Murderers</hi> of all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We are not at all beholding to them, for ſuppreſſing or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Theeves and Murderers now and then. For firſt, They are <hi>Partial;</hi> ſome Theeves and Murderers they will not puniſh, but if they have Money, they may be eaſily ſet at Liberty, by one ſubtil <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion or other.</hi> Secondly, Thoſe they do puniſh, are moſt of their own making, as I ſhewed before. Thirdly, And they encreaſe more continually, hang one, and make two. And, Fourthly, They do worſe themſelves than thoſe they do puniſh. And Laſtly, If we were rid of <hi>Tyrants,</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſing Governours,</hi> we could take care our ſelves, to ſet up ſuch as would execute Juſtice impartially, and neither rob nor mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us <hi>themſelves,</hi> nor ſuffer others to do it; both which theſe wicked Rulers do.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But the reaſon why we are commanded to be ſubject to Magiſtrates, is not becauſe they do us ſome good, but becauſe they <hi>are Servants to us, for good,</hi> Rom. 13.4. It is a madneſs to ſay they are Servants to us for good, becauſe they do ſome good. Would you ſay he were a Servant for good to his Maſter, that would rob him, and take away his goods to ſpend upon his luſts, and lay violent hands upon him, if he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove him, becauſe he would work ſometimes, and keep other Theeves out of the houſe; he is a Servant for good that fulfils his Relation, and performs the duty of a Servant. And ſo it is concerning the Magiſtrate, if he do that good which a publick Servant to the People is bound to do, he is a Servant to them for Good. If he <hi>oppreſs, enſlave, impoveriſh, perſecute</hi> them, though he may do ſome good, yet he is not a Servant to them <hi>for good,</hi> and they owe him no ſubjection. An oppreſſing Magiſtrate,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:95245:40"/>
neither keeps his Relation of a Servant to the People, nor anſwers the End for which he was made, <hi>Their Good;</hi> but makes himſelf their Lord, and ſeeks their hurt; and the little good he doth, doth not compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate for the great Evil.</p>
               <p>We are commanded to be ſubject to the Magiſtrate, not becauſe of ſome good he doth, but becauſe he is a Servant to us for good indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that is, all the good which his Office enjoyns him to do us.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Apoſtle gives this reaſon, why we ſhould not reſiſt the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, becauſe we need not fear him if we do well, but ſhall have praiſe of him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. now though a Tyrant may poſſibly do ſome good, yet we cannot have praiſe of him when we do well, nay we carry our Liberties and Lives in our hands, when we go about the beſt Duties. We cannot meet together, to ſerve God as he hath commanded us, but we are in danger of the loſs of our Liberties, Livelihoods, nay and Lives alſo; for many have caught their Deaths in Priſons of late. Therefore this pretence of ſome good, is but a meer airy notion, inſtead of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And laſtly, The Apoſtle gives this for the reaſon why we are to be ſubject to Magiſtrates, and pay them Tribute, becauſe they continually attend upon this thing; that is, doing juſtice, and ſeeking our good, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. not becauſe we receive ſome good from them, as the pretenders affirm; but becauſe they make it their work, and continual endeavour to do us good. <hi>Aſſidue incumbentes,</hi> ſome render it, but I ſuppoſe it might better be rendred, <hi>fortiter inſtantes,</hi> the word denotes, <hi>vehement perſeverance:</hi> they put all their might and ſtrength (conſtantly) to the performance of their Duty. But be that neglects the greateſt part of his Duty, and is careleſs in his Office, or continually oppreſſing us, though he may poſſibly do ſome good, hath no right to ſubjection or tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute from the People.</p>
               <p>So that you ſee plainly, what kind of Power God hath forbid us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, and what Rulers he hath commanded us to be ſubject unto.</p>
               <p>A Power that is juſt, rational, and profitable to us; but an unjuſt, arbitrary, tyrannical, or oppreſſive Power, he hath not commanded us to be ſubject unto. Rulers, Magiſtrates, that execute Juſtice, puniſh evil doers, praiſe them that do well, and are Servants to us for good, we muſt needs be ſubject unto for Conſcience ſake; but no command to ſubmit to Tyrants or Oppreſſors.</p>
               <p>The ſame anſwer is to be made to that in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13, 14. that though the Apoſtle commands us, to ſubmit to ſuch Governours, as are ſent for the puniſhment of evil doers, and praiſe of them that do well; yet he doth not command us to ſubmit to ſuch as puniſh us for doing
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95245:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
well, or oppreſs us. And ſo we are to underſtand all other Scriptures, that ſpeak of obedience and ſubjection to Magiſtrates, they mean righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Magiſtrates, not Oppreſſors.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond Argument to prove that we owe the Magiſtrate no paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive obedience, in caſe of Tyranny or Oppreſſion, but may lawfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That which the Law of Nature teacheth all men to do, cannot be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Nature teacheth to reſiſt all that come to Oppreſs or Injure us, as well the Magiſtrate as others;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore it cannot be unlawful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If a Magiſtrate ſhould offer violence to any Womans chaſtity, and unleſs ſhe ſhould yeeld her Body to him, threaten to kill her, will not Nature it ſelf teach her to reſiſt him and defend her ſelf if ſhe can?</p>
               <p>If a Magiſtrate who ought to Protect me and my Relations, will come to Murder my Wife and Children, doth not Nature command me to defend them, and reſiſt him?</p>
               <p>Nature teacheth all creatures to reſiſt injury, and defend themſelves one way or other; and who would be ſo childiſh as to affirm, that Reaſon teacheth men to lay aſide Self-defence, and ſuffer others to deſtroy us, under a pretence of Authority? If we conſult with Reaſon it will tell us, that the wickedneſs of a Magiſtrate in oppreſſing us, who is our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to protect us, is far greater than the wickedneſs of one private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons oppreſſing another.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We have ſeveral preſidents in Scripture of the Lords People, that have reſiſted wicked and tyrannous Governours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>David</hi> reſiſted <hi>Saul,</hi> who ſought his Life unjuſtly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He being <hi>Sauls</hi> Servant went away without his leave, yea contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his will, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He raiſed an Army to defend himſelf, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.2. If it be ſaid, they came to him voluntarily; I anſwer, that is nothing to the purpoſe; for within <hi>Sauls</hi> Kingdom, <hi>David</hi> headed an Army, contrary to the will of the King. <hi>He became their Captain,</hi> the Text ſaith.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is plain, that <hi>David</hi> made war in his own Defence: Becauſe the Spirit of God ſaies, <hi>Thoſe that came to David, came to him as helpers of the War,</hi> 1 Chron. 12.1, and <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>The Children of Benjamin and Judah came to help him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. And the Spirit of God pronounceth a bleſſing on them that came to help <hi>David</hi> againſt the Tyranny of <hi>Saul, verſ.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And God himſelf took his part, <hi>He helped him, verſ.</hi> 18. The Lord takes part with the poor Innocent, when they take up Arms in their own defence againſt Tyrants.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:95245:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>Object. <hi>But this was an extraordinary Caſe, David was anointed to be King to ſucceed Saul, and therefore he might uſe an extraordinary way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelf, which another might not have done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Though <hi>David</hi> was anointed to ſucceed <hi>Saul,</hi> yet he did not pretend thereby any preſent right to the Government, or that he was thereby authorized to take up Armes againſt <hi>Saul;</hi> but he juſtifies his practiſe, by his Innocency, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.17. He had not deſerved to be ſo perſecuted by <hi>Saul,</hi> becauſe he had done no wrong, and what he did was in his own defence; which the Law of Nature taught him to do: and thoſe that helped him, came to him as an innocent oppreſſed man, whoſe Life was ſought unjuſtly by a wicked Tyrant, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.1. they heard how <hi>Saul</hi> hunted after his Life, and made him hide himſelf, and therefore came to help him; which I ſhall ſhew hereafter is no more than the Law of God requires the People to do, to deliver the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent from the hand of the Oppreſſor.</p>
               <p>Another preſident we have, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.44, <hi>and</hi> 45. <hi>verſes.</hi>

               <p>When <hi>Saul</hi> would have put <hi>Jonathan</hi> to death unjuſtly, the People reſiſted him both in word and deed. <hi>Saul</hi> had not onely ſaid but confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it with an Oath or a Curſe, that <hi>Jonathan ſhould ſurely dye.</hi> The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſay and ſwear the Contrary. <hi>As the Lord liveth, not one hair of his head ſhall fall to the ground.</hi> And they made good their word, <hi>for they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcued Jonathan that he died not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So likewiſe <hi>Eliſha</hi> defended himſelf againſt King <hi>Joram</hi>'s Tyranny, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.32. The King ſwears he would have <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s head from off his ſhoulders before night, ſends a Meſſenger to apprehend him, and follows himſelf at the Meſſengers feet, becauſe he would be ſure to ſee it executed. Was <hi>Eliſha</hi> bound to ſubmit to this unjuſt Sentence, and yeeld his neck to the Tyrant, who came to murder him, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of his Authority? <hi>Eliſha</hi> underſtood himſelf better than ſo: <hi>See ye</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>how this ſon of a Murderer hath ſent to take away my head. Look when the Meſſenger comes, ſhut the door, and hold him faſt at the door; is not the ſound of his Maſter's feet behind him?</hi> Here was a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent reſiſtance of the tyrannous Power of the King, in his own defence. The <hi>Septuagent</hi> renders it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>bruiſe him in the door.</hi> As for that pretence, <hi>Eliſha</hi> was a Prophet, an extra<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>dinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it is not lawful for another to do ſo, becauſe <hi>Eliſha</hi> did; it is ſcarcely worth an anſwer. For <hi>Eliſha</hi> defended himſelf as a man, he pretended nothing extraordinary, but reſiſted one that came to murder him, which Nature would have taught any man in the world to do. And indeed if there had been never an example of this nature in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet the very Light of Reaſon were ſufficient to determine the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:95245:42"/>
caſe. Yea, the very Prelates, and other Advocates of Tyranny, are forced to confeſs, That in many caſes it is lawful, not only for the body of the People, or the leſſer part of them, but for particular perſons, to reſiſt the King.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But doth not the Apoſtle command Servants to be ſubject to evil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters as well as good, and to take it patiently when they are buffeted for doing well?</hi> 1 Pet. 2.18. <hi>Will it not follow much more that we muſt be ſubject to evil Magiſtrates as well as good, and take it patiently, when they puniſh us for doing well?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. The ſcope of the place ſhews, the Apoſtle doth not mean an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute or univerſal ſubjection, in all caſes whatſoever, but in ſmaller injuries, which may be eaſily born and put up (for the ſake of peace and quietneſs) better ſuffered than reſiſted.</p>
               <p>If a Maſter be froward, croſs and crabbed, apt to revile his Servants, and give them evil language, they muſt not revile again, or return the like language to their Maſters, which they receive from them; which is the Apoſtles meaning, as you may ſee by comparing ver. 18. with 23.</p>
               <p>If a Maſter ſhould buffet his Servant, or (as we commonly term it) cuff him about the ears, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>if being cuffed.</hi> The Apoſtle tells us what kind of injuries he means; ſuch common injuries as may better be patiently ſuffered, than violently reſiſted. But it would be a madneſs, to argue from this place, that if a Maſter ſhould offer to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh his Servant, or if ſhe cryed out, to cut her throat, or come with a ſword to kill his Servant, or with a club to knock his Servant down, that the Servant ought to be ſubject, and take it patiently. So that if we ſhould grant that there is the ſame reaſon why the People ſhould ſuffer injuries patiently from evil Magiſtrates, that there is for Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to ſuffer patiently from evil Maſters, it would prove no more but this; that we muſt ſubmit to them in ſome ſmaller injuries, which we may put up without any great inconvenience; but not that we ſhould ſuffer them to murder us, or our friends, to lay us up in filthy Dungeons till we are poiſoned and ſtifled up with the ſtink of them, or to beggar our Wives and Children to ſatisfie their luſts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But indeed there is no ſuch reaſon, why the People ſhould ſuffer injuries pati<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>tly from Magiſtrates, without reſiſting, as why Servants ſhould from their Maſters; and therefore the Objection is of no force. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. God hath commanded Servants to ſuffer leſſer injuries patiently from their Maſters; but he hath not commanded the People to ſuffer ſuch things from the Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Magiſtrate is not the Peoples Maſter, but (as I have proved
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:95245:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
before) their Servant: and therefore, this place proves rather the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, That if the People, who are in truth and reality the Magiſtrate's Maſter, ſhould offer any leſſer injury to the Magiſtrate who is their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, he ought to ſuffer it patiently at their hands. So that alwayes the very weapons which the Kings-men fight withal, wound themſelves. Alas, poor men, they grope at noon-day, and ſtumble at the light, their own Arguments ſtab their cauſe to the heart. Yea, truly I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire no more to prove the lawfulneſs of reſiſting a tyrannous and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing Magiſtrate, than what they urge againſt it.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But doth not Chriſt forbid us to reſiſt evil?</hi> Mat. 25.39.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> This place forbids us no more to reſiſt a wicked Magiſtrate, than any other wicked man. For there is not a word peculiar to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate in this command. But ſuppoſe it were appropriate to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, it would prove no more than this, that we are to put up ſome leſſer injuries, as that other place requires Servants to do from their Maſters, and not return evil for evil. Which is evident to be our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's meaning,</p>
               <p n="1">1. By the occaſion of theſe words. <hi>Ye have heard it hath been ſaid, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.</hi> That is, It hath been common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judged lawful among you, to revenge your ſelves, and do to others what evil they have done unto you: but I forbid this, ſayes Chriſt; it is an evil thing ſo to do, <hi>you ſhall not render evil for evil.</hi> And indeed it is no more than Reaſon it ſelf dictates: for though Reaſon teach us to defend our ſelves, and not ſuffer others to beat out our eyes or teeth, if we can hinder it; yet if a man ſhould take an advantage, and beat out my eye or tooth, before I were aware, it were not rational for me to fall upon him and return the ſame, but right my ſelf in a wiſer man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And the particular caſes Chriſt mentions, ſhew he means leſſer injuries. <hi>If one ſmite thee on the cheek</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Eraſmus, Hemſius, Soultetus,</hi> and other learned men (as <hi>Leigh</hi> obſerves) underſtand it, of ſtriking, not with the fiſt, but the palm of the hand, a box of the ear. And our Tranſlators render the word, <hi>ſmiting with the palm of the hand, Matth.</hi> 26.27.</p>
               <p>Another injury Chriſt would not have us to reſiſt with violence, is, If a man take away our coat, or compel us to go a mile with him, he means, that we ſhould rather put up ſmall injuries, thereby to win men to the Goſpel, than by contending with them, or rendring evil for evil, loſe the opportunity of gaining them to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:95245:43"/>But if you would underſtand the words, <hi>Reſiſt not Evil,</hi> to forbid all Reſiſtance of Evil, it were impoſſible for the World to ſubſiſt: For if we may not reſiſt thoſe who come to murder us, rob us, burn houſes, raviſh women, carry away our children for ſlaves, and do ſuch like intolerable evils, we muſt go out of the World, for there is no living here.</p>
               <p>I conclude therefore, that this place doth not forbid a private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to reſiſt any great and unſufferable Evil, which may be offered to the Life, Liberty or Eſtate, of himſelf or others; much leſs doth it forbid the People to reſiſt a Cruel and Tyrannous Governour, who by his Office is bound to protect them, and yet moſt perfidiouſly and traiterouſly, doth oppreſs them, murdering ſome, impriſoning others, for doing well, impoveriſhing and enſlaving all.</p>
